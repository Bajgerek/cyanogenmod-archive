				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been pretty quiet publicly on the CM13 (Marshmallow) progress, but we&#8217;ve been busy bees behind the scenes. Today, we&#8217;ve enabled the first wave of devices to receive CM13 nightlies. Now, before you jump head first into flashing these, please take a moment to read the items below &#8211; as they will impact your experience.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are on CM 12.1 YOG4P or CM 12.1 YOG7D releases, we recommend you stay on course with the SNAPSHOT release channel and not jump to nightlies unless you are willing to accept a dip in quality. Our stable branches are vetted, CTS run and (in some cases) shipped on retail devices &#8211; which means the quality of those branches is far and above that of nightlies. We&#8217;d advise these folks to stay on the SNAPSHOT train, and we&#8217;ll have a quality approved SNAPSHOT for CM13 sometime Jan.</li>
<li>If you are on a 12.1 nightly, you can &#8216;dirty flash&#8217; CM13 (read update like any sane person) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as long as you also update your third party addons in the same pass</span>. This means, if you use Xposed, OpenGapps, etc. flash a Marshmallow compatible version of them immediately after your CM13 flash.</li>
<li>If you have taken any unofficial, XDA or self made builds of the CM13 source code, we&#8217;d advise you to wipe upon coming to our official nightlies as we cannot ensure upgrade compatibility with third party distributions. Of course, you are welcome to not heed our suggestion, but don&#8217;t blame us if something goes sideways.</li>
</ol>
<p>The device roster is starting small, and will grow over the next few weeks.</p>
<ol>
<li>OnePlus One (bacon)</li>
<li>Nexus 7 (deb &amp; flo)</li>
<li>LG G4 (h815)</li>
<li>Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 (mondrianwifi)</li>
<li>LG GPad 7.0 (v400 &amp; v410)</li>
<li>LG G3 Verizon (vs985)</li>
<li>Moto X 2014 (victara)</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s a decent spread of OEMs and a bit all over the place, but as stated, we&#8217;re working on our other 12.1 devices and this list will grow rapidly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At its core, CyanogenMod is a best in class example of Open Source development. Secure, fast, and full of meaningful choices for users, our goal is to make the world’s best Android OS available to hundreds of millions of users around the world.</p>
<p>Along with the resources of Cyanogen Inc. behind it, we’ve created the Platform SDK. This platform empowers developers to scale the open development of Android through CyanogenMod.</p>
<figure><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image02.jpg"><img class=" aligncenter" src="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image02.jpg" alt="image02" /></a></figure>
<p>The Cyanogen Platform SDK is about safely giving developers deeper access to Android, while enabling them to create original experiences for users. Whether it’s creating new ways of engaging with existing applications or developing completely new experiences, our goal is to make sure the Cyanogen platform offers meaningful choices to meet the growing needs of a diverse, global smartphone population (6b+ by 2020).</p>
<p>As we approach <a href="http://hacktheplanet.mlh.io/">Hack The Planet</a>, we wanted to share the first apps that are leveraging the Platform SDK to bring more functionality to users daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>Kelvin Sense:</strong><br />
<a href="https://senseai.io/kelvin-sense">Kelvin Sense</a> is a thermometer that utilizes the implicit temperature dependence of the sensors and other electronic components in existing devices to determine the ambient temperature in a variety of situations. The heat generated by the various sensors, as well as the processor, screen, battery, WiFi, GSM/CDMA, and GPS are combined using a mathematical model of the device whose output accurately measures the temperature of the surroundings.</p>
<p>Sense Ai has generalized this approach in their SDK to provide an array of previously unmeasurable quantities and environmental states.</p>
<figure><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/pasted-image-01.png"><img class=" aligncenter" src="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/pasted-image-01-576x1024.png" alt="pasted image 0" width="290" height="515" /></a></figure>
<p>With integration into Quick Settings Tiles, it is as easy as a swipe to know more about your personal environment. You can see in the image above that it was much hotter in Palo Alto in general than the building I was in when I captured the screenshot. The enhanced app will be available on the OnePlus One when OS 12.1 rolls out and to other Cyanogen OS devices after that.</p>
<p>Have any questions? <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KelvinSense">Reach out and say hello to the team</a></p>
<p><strong>Dual SIM Control:</strong><br />
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.joaormf.mtkcontrol">Dual SIM</a> is something that is becoming more and more relevant as new users adopt smartphones around the world. We connected with João, the creator of Dual SIM Control, because we saw that his app has very positive user reviews, even though in many cases it requires root access. We’ve been blown away by the quality and speed of João’s development and are thrilled that his Dual SIM API is the first 3rd party API to be added to the SDK.</p>
<p>He’s combined his new API with the Quick Settings API to give users seamless control over their Dual SIM use.</p>
<p>As Adnan mentioned in his <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/update-to-cyanogen-platform-sdk">last post</a>, we’re moving to a quarterly release cadence for stable branching, so access to the enhanced Dual SIM app and the API will have to wait a bit longer for Cyanogen OS &amp; CyanogenMod (non-nightly) devices.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1GDkLrnI9M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Tasker:</strong><br />
If you don’t know what <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm">Tasker</a> is, it’s an advanced application that allows users to automate actions based on different triggers. We’re working with the creator, Pent, to implement an extension using the Platform SDK which you can look for soon.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning. The Community and Cyanogen are working to provide more tooling, experiences and access to continue making the Android platform more open and provide choice to users around the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitch.tv/mlh">Tune-in to Twitch</a> this Sunday at 3pm PDT to see what 400 of the brightest college hackers around the world create with the Cyanogen Platform SDK.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Update to Cyanogen Platform SDK</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Written by Adnan Begovic, In Developer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">After the announcement of the <a href="https://www.cyngn.com/developer-blog/introducing-the-cyanogen-platform-sdk">Platform SDK</a> in May we had a healthy amount of interest from users, CyanogenMod community developers, and third party Android developers. Since then we’ve had a stable release of the first version of the SDK, created further infrastructure to enable easier accessibility and maintenance, and expanded on the features available to third party app developers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a recap for release notes, the CM SDK hit a stable branching point for 12.1 on June 22nd, 2015. With this stable branching we’ve introduced a <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_prebuilts_cmsdk">prebuilts</a> repo which can be utilized to reference prebuilt, statically linkable java archives that match the current stable release. Likewise we’ve also updated the platform sdk’s <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/cm_platform_sdk/wiki">wiki</a> to detail everything from the downloading and including the jar in your own applications to the submission and testing process revolving around the infrastructure of the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The current stable SDK release is titled “Apricot”, and the java archive it represents can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_prebuilts_cmsdk/tree/master/current">prebuilts/current</a> repo and it contains the capability of the <a href="https://cyanogenmod.github.io/cm_platform_sdk/reference/cyanogenmod/app/CustomTile.html">CustomTile API</a> which allows your application to post its own toggles to the QS Panel within the quick settings drawer. A usage of the CustomTile API is exemplified by one of our OSS members in recent community releases as the backing framework for <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/latest-updates-to-cm-12-1">Dynamic Tiles</a>. These dynamic tiles within the OS now allow us to see things like active root sessions (per application) within our community builds.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image01.png"><img class="alignnone" alt="image01" src="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image01-168x300.png" /></a><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image00.png"><img class="alignleft" alt="image00" src="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image00-168x300.png" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">With moving towards the next release named “Boysenberry”, we’ve spent time factoring out one of our most prominent features within the OS known as “Profiles”. The Profiles API has always been hidden away internally in the android framework in CyanogenMod, but we’ll now be looking to expose it to any third party application which may be interested. Originally contributed by community member <a href="https://github.com/martinlong1978">Martin Long</a>, the Profiles API has allowed for managing different device states and behavior based off of environmental triggers such as bluetooth connecting to a certain device or WiFi disconnecting from a specific AP. Since the Profiles API’s introduction into CyanogenMod, the OS’s settings application has been the primary management tool for any user wanting to create their own device profiles, starting today any application can become a management tool for profiles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Profiles API allows you to override numerous default settings for the user depending on a trigger. You can programmatically create a Profile which sets the ring mode on the device to muted, disables WiFi, and switches the devices default data connection to 3G all with a few lines of code.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An example list of override-able settings can be seen here:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AirplaneMode</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Brightness level</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Audio stream volumes</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Alarm</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">DTMF</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Music</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Notification</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Phone Ring</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">System sounds</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Voice call</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ring Modes</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Connection Settings</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Data Connection (2g/3g/4g)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bluetooth</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">GPS</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">NFC</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Data sync</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">WiFi</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Expanded Desktop</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Doze mode</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Screen Lock</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">These settings can quickly be overridden by utilizing the Profile class and the ProfileManager (for publishing). A quick example of creating a profile which overrides the default AirplaneMode setting and then sets the profile to active can be seen below.</p>
<pre><code class="java">private void createOverrideForAPandSetActive() {
    // Get instance of ProfileManager
    ProfileManager profileManager = ProfileManager.getInstance(this);

    // Create new Profile object with name
    Profile profile = new Profile("Custom Profile AP Override");
    // Of type Toggle
    profile.setProfileType(Type.TOGGLE);
    // Where we set the default airplane mode setting to enabled
    AirplaneModeSettings airplaneModeSettings =
            new AirplaneModeSettings(
                AirplaneModeSettings.BooleanState.STATE_ENABLED, true);
    profile.setAirplaneMode(airplaneModeSettings);
    // Add the profile to the internal map
    profileManager.addProfile(profile);
    // And set it active
    profileManager.setActiveProfile(profile.getUuid());
}</code></pre>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve also recently supplied new functionality within the <a href="https://cyanogenmod.github.io/cm_platform_sdk/reference/cyanogenmod/app/CustomTile.html">CustomTile</a> API, allowing you go as far as publishing <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RemoteViews.html">RemoteViews</a> as an <a href="https://cyanogenmod.github.io/cm_platform_sdk/reference/cyanogenmod/app/CustomTile.RemoteExpandedStyle.html">ExpandedStyle</a> to be shown for when the user interacts with the tile itself. A quick example that inflates a layout containing a button can be seen here:</p>
<pre><code class="java">private void createRemoteViewExpandedTile() {
    // Create a remoteviews object
    RemoteViews contentView = new RemoteViews(getPackageName(),
            R.layout.remote_view);

    // Create intent for the onclick button
    Intent cyngnIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)
        .setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)
        .setData(Uri.parse("http://www.cyngn.com"));

    // Get a pending intent for the defined intent
    PendingIntent intent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0,
            cyngnIntent, 0);

    // Set the pending intent on the button in our layout
    contentView.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.whats_hot_click, intent);

    // Create the new RemoteExpandedStyle
    CustomTile.RemoteExpandedStyle remoteExpandedStyle =
            new CustomTile.RemoteExpandedStyle();
    remoteExpandedStyle.setRemoteViews(contentView);

    // Build the custom tile
    CustomTile customTile = new CustomTile.Builder(CMStatusBarTest.this)
        .setLabel("Remote Style From SDK")
        .setIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)
        .setExpandedStyle(remoteExpandedStyle)
        .setOnSettingsClickIntent(new Intent(thiis, DummyClass.class)
                .setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK))
        .setContentDescription("Description of content for expanded style")
        .build();

    // Publish the custom tile
    CMStatusBarManager.getInstance(this)
            .publishTile(CUSTOM_TILE_SETTINGS_ID, customTile);
}</code></pre>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image03.png"><img class="aligncenter" alt="image03" src="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image03-168x300.png" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, we’re trending towards a quarterly release cadence for our stable branching and the Profiles API will be constantly worked on and refactored alongside other interface and feature work. However, we’ve made available a bleeding edge java archive which contains access to these new features with our nightly builds on CyanogenMod. The java archive can be found within the <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_prebuilts_cmsdk/tree/master/future">future</a> folder of the CMSDK prebuilts with documentation always-up-to-date which can be found on the <a href="https://cyanogenmod.github.io/cm_platform_sdk/reference/packages.html">github page for the project.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Likewise, to help decipher which APIs are available to you at any given point (if at all), we’ve created a copy of the <a href="https://cyanogenmod.github.io/cm_platform_sdk/reference/cyanogenmod/os/Build.html">Build API</a> from AOSP allowing you to programmatically compare the devices current API version to see if specific features are available or not.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A simple call to retrieve the <a href="https://cyanogenmod.github.io/cm_platform_sdk/reference/cyanogenmod/os/Build.CM_VERSION.html#SDK_INT">SDK constant</a> and comparing it against the <a href="https://cyanogenmod.github.io/cm_platform_sdk/reference/cyanogenmod/os/Build.CM_VERSION_CODES.html#BOYSENBERRY">Boysenberry API level</a> allows you to see if your application is running on a CyanogenMod device that can support the new SDK feature:</p>
<pre><code class="java">private void removeActiveProfile() {
    // Make sure we're running on BoysenBerry or higher to use Profiles API
    if (Build.CM_VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.CM_VERSION_CODES.BOYSENBERRY) {
        ProfileManager profileManager = ProfileManager.getInstance(this);
        Profile activeProfile = profileManager.getActiveProfile();
        if (activeProfile != null) {
            profileManager.removeProfile(activeProfile);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p dir="ltr">Along with the new tooling available in the SDK, we’ve also expanded our test coverage on the overall project itself. For future submissions or contributions, in an effort to push for a more stable platform, we will be requiring that each change to existing APIs passes the current tests and that any feature or interface change comes supplemented with newer tests. To see more details on the testing package, view the package on <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/cm_platform_sdk/tree/cm-12.1/tests">Github</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore we will be partaking in numerous upcoming events to help further provide exposure and developer support.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Upcoming Event Lineup for 2015</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">August 2015 &#8211; Seattle Code Rush hosted by Facebook</p>
<p dir="ltr">August 2015 &#8211; Hack the Planet Hosted by Major League Hacking</p>
<p dir="ltr">October 2015 &#8211; Big Android BBQ</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to be confused with the device from the makers of humongous tinfoil catamarans, the M8 release of CyanogenMod 11.0 is well under way. Builds began last night, and will continue into today. In lieu of posting a changelog, you can learn more about the majority of changes via our last recap <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/last-week-in-cm-jun-19-2014">post</a>.</p>
<p>A quick FAQ for those common questions asked:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>When was M8 branched?</strong>  The M8 code was branched to stable on June 30th and is based on Android 4.4.4.</li>
<li><strong>What is the last &#8216;safe&#8217; nightly I can upgrade from?</strong> The last nightly you can upgrade from without chance of issues is June 29th.</li>
<li><strong>I didn&#8217;t see/know there were such considerations as #1 and #2, and now Settings is crashing &#8211; what can I do? </strong>Clear the data for the Settings app &#8211; this can be accessed via the recents menu (long press the Settings multitask item).</li>
<li><strong>Why is #3 happening? </strong>By being on a newer nightly than June 30th, your Settings database version is higher than that of the M release &#8211; and downgrades of database versions are not allowed in Android.</li>
<li><strong>Where is my device?</strong> Currently, the builds have not yet completed, your device may yet still be under way. In the event your device did not get an M8 release, then consider it not deemed ready by your maintainer.</li>
<li><strong>What about [xyz device] that CM doesn&#8217;t yet support? </strong>Aliens</li>
<li><strong>CM SUCKS AND BROKE ALL THE THINGS! </strong>Thank you for your valuable feedback &#8211; please direct your bug report to our <a href="https://jira.cyanogenmod.org/">JIRA instance</a> with a log so we can suck less.</li>
<li><strong>Why did CM abandon [xyz device]?</strong> We didn&#8217;t. If we discontinued support for a device, we would announce the reasons why. No M8 release for your device does not equate to abandonment &#8211; it means we know something is broken, and would rather not subject the masses to that item.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>Happy Flashing</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May the Fourth, and M6 builds are  <a href="http://download.cyanogenmod.org/">Community Distribution</a> channel. The changelog is further down this page, but first, let&#8217;s have a chat.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Where is stable CM11?</strong></span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet&#8221; &#8211; Romeo &amp; Juliet</p>
<p>As part of my daily CM routine, I am constantly looking around for the general opinion pieces of what and how we are doing, not because of vanity, but because its the most direct way for me to figure out what topics I should discuss in future posts.</p>
<p>With the release of M6 (and even earlier in the CM11 cycle) I began to see this sentiment of &#8220;why haven&#8217;t they hit [a build labelled] stable yet?&#8221; followed immediately after by &#8220;why are [CM] so slow now?&#8221;. I had hoped that much of this discussion was curtailed by the <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/cm-11-m4-post-release-items">M4 Post-Release</a> entry, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. So, attempt #2:</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect a build labelled &#8216;stable&#8217;. The &#8216;M&#8217; builds have supplanted our need for such a release. This also means you will not being seeing &#8216;RC&#8217; builds.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why?</span></p>
<p>To answer why, you have to understand just what it was the &#8216;stable&#8217; builds afforded us. Beyond just being a trusted label to assuage the more risk-adverse users, it was our marker for accepting reports to our bug tracker. This had a few pain points, but most notably, it meant months of code would be introduced with no particular predictability, which led to gaps between identifying issues from your reports, fixing them and then releasing them in the next stable. With a &#8216;stable&#8217; and &#8216;nightly&#8217; only structure, you either waited months for a fix, or updated to a nightly &#8211; and with the risk of items such as the &#8216;master key&#8217; and &#8216;Heartbleed&#8217; vulnerabilities, this became an unacceptable risk we were posing to you all.</p>
<p>The &#8216;M&#8217;s have now become the fix for that particular issue; you can now reliably know that your next batch of fixes will arrive 4 weeks after the last (and if you are using a nightly, you are not stripped of your ability to update whenever you want). This also allows helps us collect JIRA tickets more frequently and track progression or regression of features in smaller windows.</p>
<p>Like the &#8216;stables&#8217; before it, &#8216;M&#8217; releases are built off the &#8216;stable/CM-##.#&#8217; branches &#8211; the only difference is now frequency and label. We could have chosen to remove &#8216;M&#8217; releases and stick with the &#8216;stable&#8217; tag instead for these monthlies, but the word &#8216;stable&#8217; itself is a misnomer &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t mean bug free and it certainly never meant feature complete; but with the name &#8216;stable&#8217; it gave the false impression that it did mean those things &#8211; especially to those risk-adverse that would only hop from &#8216;stable&#8217; to &#8216;stable&#8217;.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We can go faster</span></p>
<p>Our goal is to get a release out every 2 weeks with the same quality and expectations you would have of a &#8216;stable&#8217; release (label for that yet undecided). But with that goal, it further underscores how the label &#8216;stable&#8217; no longer works for us. With the current M cycle, we have gotten our routine down to every 4 weeks; to get it to 2 weeks is ambitious, but we can do it, and it would benefit everyone. At a 2 week cycle, you are not subjected to the rollercoaster that is nightlies. At a 2 week cycle we can collect and act on JIRA  reports with more immediacy. At a 2 week cycle new devices or those that miss a release due to being withheld can enter the release cycle again at the next build (assuming issues are resolved). And of course, with this being CM, you can choose to take or ignore an update as you&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>This has a lot of dependencies of course. We need to make sure even more issues are discovered and fleshed out at the code review stage, that our maintainers and contributors are more present on the CM forums and JIRA, and that users feel that their voices are contributing something. It will take some time, but I, personally, would like to see us at this stage across the board by the end of this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Week Ending: April 12, 2014</p>
<p><em>“This Week in CyanogenMod” is an ongoing feature that aims to serve as a one-stop shop for weekly updates. Topics discussed are culled from our social media accounts, gerrit, status updates and general thoughts.</em></p>
<p>Heartbleed, devices, theme engine and more &#8211; plenty to discuss this week.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heartbleed</span></p>
<p>As a somewhat lucky coincidence, the Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability was disclosed during the period of time our data center was offline (Note: downtime was unrelated to Heartbleed). What this did allow us to do was patch all appropriate web assets susceptible to Heartbleed before we brought services back up. Do note, that due to the nature of this vulnerability if you use a common password it is wise to change your passwords once all the other affected sites have signalled the all clear.</p>
<p>On the Android side of things, CM 10.1, 10.2 and 11 builds are unaffected at a core OS level (your apps may use their own OpenSSL implementation). Android 4.1.1 was known to be susceptible, however heartbeats were disabled in Android 4.1.2; if you happen to be on a nightly corresponding to Android 4.1.1, an update is recommended. CM 10.0 stable was released based on the 4.1.2 code and is not impacted.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HTC One Mini </span>(m4)</p>
<p>Not to be confused with our monthly &#8216;M&#8217; builds, or its bigger brother the HTC One 2012 (m7) &#8211; the HTC One Mini is now receiving nightly builds. Your maintainers are veteran CM maintainer h8rift and newcomer Jurica Vukadin (u-ra).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HTC One 2014</span> (m8)</p>
<p>Marketed as <em>The New</em> HTC One, this device (m8) is the successor to the m7. H8rift, toastcfh, deck, invisiblek and other CM maintainers have already taken up the challenge to bringing CM to this device. No builds yet to share, but we will keep you updated as things progress.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amazon Kindle Fire HD</span></p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of Hashcode (with bootimg setup by verygreen), the Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#8243; (jem) and Kindle Fire HD 7&#8243; (tate) have officially been merged into our Github repository. These OMAP based devices are waiting on one final kernel repository change (really just a rename) prior to making their debut on nightly rotation. Look for builds later this week.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Theme Engine </span></p>
<p>A <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/102878569352950531397">couple weeks ago</a>, we started a limited alpha test of a new and improve theme engine for CyanogenMod. This new engine pulls together previous contributions from Sony Mobile &amp; T-Mobile and is supplemented by nearly 5 months of work from Cyanogen Inc engineers Andy Mast and Clark Scheff. This week, we merged the core pieces of this new engine into our Github.</p>
<p>So just what is better about this engine? We&#8217;d like to think just about everything.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The new theme engine allows the following:<br />
1. Simple creation of themes by compiling on the device<br />
2. System level icon packs.<br />
3. Font packs<br />
4. Swappable boot animations<br />
5. Lockscreen wallpaper<br />
6. Alarms<br />
7.  Of course all the things the previous engine could do including skins, ringtones and notifications. There is also legacy support for old themes.</p>
<p>Prior to the public alpha, we reached out to theme creators to give them a head-start in playing with the new engine and creating themes to utilize the new features. We are also working on tools to make themes easier for everyone to create. Lots of fun stuff is just around the corner <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gerrit review </span></p>
<p>A quick stroll through our recent features merged in to CM 11 mainline:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">* Lockscreen: custom wallpaper</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">* Lockscreen: third party keyguard support</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">* Translations: migrate to <a href="http://translate.cyanogenmod.org">Crowdin support</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">* Blacklist: add explicit permissions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">* SMS: support for &#8220;mark unread&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">* Voice+: migrate options to settings menu</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">* Quiet Hours: 4-state support(timed active/inactive, forced on/off)</p>
<p>Patches still needing review include custom grid layouts and hidden applications in Trebuchet and OpenCNAM caller ID support in Dialer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Case Chase</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll do a wrap-up of the joint giveaway between CyanogenMod, Cyanogen Inc. and OnePlus &#8211; but first, a very special thank you to CM contributors Bumble-Bee, Dvtonder, and mad-murdock. We couldn&#8217;t have pulled off the international pieces without their assistance.</p>
<p><em>Got a suggestion for a topic you’d like to see in the next round-up? Let us know in the comments below. </em><strong><em>All device/port requests will be ignored.</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/cyanogenmod-11-0-m4-release">yesterday&#8217;s M4 release</a> all wrapped up, this is the perfect time to &#8216;talk shop&#8217; about the releases in general and some of the comments we are seeing.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the M&#8217;s for?</span></p>
<p>The M-releases are our best effort to provide an actual &#8216;release cycle&#8217; for ourselves and users alike. In previous generations of CM, we were super active but released sparingly, with months between releases and with an unpredictable cycle. This was bad for users, specifically those less likely to use nightlies, and bad for developers on our team &#8211; never knowing in advance when we&#8217;d collectively say &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s do a release now&#8221;.</p>
<p>M-releases exist on a monthly cycle to force our hand at not only releasing, but addressing bug-fixes in a timely manner. These releases are scheduled for the first week of every month, usually the first Friday/Saturday. Every M release for CM 11 has gone through a very specific code preparation and release process, both of which were less stringent in CM&#8217;s previous incarnations. In terms of time, this allows for roughly 3.5 weeks out of any given month for code review and mergers to be included in a release. The last week or so is spent making sure that the code for release is tested and branched accordingly to the new &#8216;stable/cm-11.0&#8242; branches on our Github (<a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_frameworks_base/tree/stable/cm-11.0">example</a>). This ensures that newer, more experimental features are properly vetted in a separate release stream, and do not impede or prevent a timely release.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What M-releases are not</span></p>
<p>When we introduced the M&#8217;s, the common consensus was that they were just specially named nightlies. This was close to true for the majority of the CM9 cycle and most of the CM 10.x cycle. With CM 11 though, this is no longer the case. <strong>CM 11 M# releases are a code path that lags <em>behind</em> nightlies</strong>.</p>
<p>This means a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Nightlies have newer code than the M-releases</span></li>
<li>You should be extra careful flashing an M build on top of a new nightly due to #1</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Practice</span></p>
<p>As the Ghostbusters would say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t cross the streams&#8221;. While this isn&#8217;t a hard-stop rule, it is still very apt advice to take into account. Let&#8217;s give you a real-world scenario.</p>
<p>M4 was branched for release last week &#8211; let&#8217;s use an easy date and say February 28th. This means all the code that exists in the stable/cm-11.0 branches on Github contain code 8 days old, with <b>only</b> bugfixes placed on top (or unstable features removed). This also means that any change merged in the last 8 days to the master &#8216;cm-11.0&#8242; branch is not captured in the branch for M4. On March 2nd, we merged in some relatively sweeping telephony changes based on QCRIL (Qualcomm specific radio code) and the beginnings of Multi-SIM phone support. If you are using a nightly from March 2nd to today, you have this new code. If you flashed M4, you don&#8217;t. Simple enough right?</p>
<p>But what happens if you are on nightly March 7, for example, and then flash M4? In terms of code, you have just <em>downgraded. </em>Downgrading can be perfectly benign, or flat out make your phone unbootable. In the QCRIL example, if you downgraded you would see broken phone calls and radio behavior. This is one of the many reasons veteran users advocate making a backup before making any changes, and we&#8217;d echo that advice.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So what are the release streams?</span></p>
<p>There are effectively 3 release streams for CM: Nightlies, M/Stable, and Installer:</p>
<p>Nightlies are <em>always</em> the most bleeding edge in code, features, and yes, bugs (including the kind that may prevent the device from booting at all).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Update process: Flash a new nightly on top of the old &#8211; no need to wipe</p>
<p>M/Stable are specifically tagged, branched, tested and released. If you are a tinkerer but adverse to the chaos of nightlies, this is for you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Update process: Flash a new M/Stable on top of the previous M/Stable &#8211; no need to wipe</p>
<p>Installer builds are those served via the CM Installer applications (Windows, Mac). These builds are specially signed and named separately &#8211; there is no concept of an &#8216;M&#8217; build for this release channel &#8211; so saying &#8216;Installer skipped M#&#8217; is an incorrect interpretation. This channel only ever receives specially created Stable builds &#8211; they even come with their own naming structure (eg XNPQ02R).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Update process: Incremental OTA&#8217;s are provided using the CMFota application &#8211; updates are handled by device logic with minimal user interaction, no wipe needed</p>
<p>If you are a nightly user, use nightlies. If you prefer to tinker but want something less chaotic, use the M/Stables. If you aren&#8217;t a tinkerer and don&#8217;t want chaos, use the Installer builds (if available).</p>
<p><strong>If you want to cross streams, make a backup first! </strong>It should also be noted, to cross into or out of the Installer build release channel <i>will require you to</i> wipe your data (due to the different key signing).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Devices and greenlights </span></p>
<p>As a team, we leave it to the maintainers to opt-in to releases. If for any reason your maintainer does not flag a device as ready for release &#8211; be it for technical reasons, lack of time, or anything else &#8211; we will not issue a release for that device.</p>
<p>For some examples, I&#8217;ll point you to the d2lte, jflte and hlte devices. These are the unified builds we <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/unified-builds">announced last month</a>. The maintainers decided that the unified devices were not ready to be issued outside of the nightly release stream and so no builds for these devices were generated.</p>
<p>Part of what I do on this project is the user interaction &#8211; talking to you all via this blog, comments, forums, social media, etc. All too often I see &#8220;you didn&#8217;t release for [device], you must have abandoned it&#8221;. This simply is not the case. You trust the CM maintainers to keep your devices functional and in a working state, if you didn&#8217;t you wouldn&#8217;t be using the work that they provide. But part of that trust also entails trusting their decision making abilities about the suitability of any device for release. These guys are working hard to get your devices in the best possible shape &#8211; so when they say &#8220;no&#8221; to any particular release, don&#8217;t take it as a slight against you, they are making a judgement call.</p>
<p>We all know that everyone wants the latest and greatest, but that mentality is for the nightly channel, and if the latest and greatest is what you want, use those. But for M/Stable, you want things that <em>work </em>(for those that will inevitably point out various bugs on M4 now, please do so constructively via <a href="https://jira.cyanogenmod.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa">JIRA</a>).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Users who took the most recent update for the CM Installer channel for d2 (Galaxy S3) and jf (Galaxy S4) devices may have seen their devices reboot into a broken state. We take full responsibility for this issue. Items such as non-boots are to be expected to occur in nightly or &#8216;experimental&#8217; builds, not the stable channel of the installer &#8211; the issues were simply unacceptable.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What happened?</span></p>
<p>Last week, we made the preparations to generate new incremental over the air updates (OTAs) and full builds for the CM installer release channel. Test builds were generated early in the week and QA tested against all of the Nexus devices and a couple other devices. Builds were cleared for release and regenerated on Friday, for a roll-out on Saturday.</p>
<p>The failures seen arise from unaccounted for repercussions of the recent effort to unify the <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/unified-builds">d2 and jf device trees</a>. The unification process itself was a success, the need for variant builds has been eliminated on these devices. When we went to roll the builds for release on Friday, we took into account that the unification process was still new, only being tested against the nightlies for 3 days at that point; as such the CM Installer releases generated on Friday were on the non-unified type (ie, individual builds for each d2 and jf variant).</p>
<p>This all should have been perfectly fine and is representative of our previous installer rollouts. However, due to the unification process, the special system files that allow your phone to boot shifted locations in a way our Installer buildbot failed to account for &#8211; essentially making the d2 and jf builds that went out to users non-bootable.</p>
<p>On Monday, when user feedback of these issues came pouring in, we took immediate action to remove the affected builds and address the root cause in both our source (to prevent this in the future) and to enhance our QA and release processes.</p>
<p>No one wants to see this happen again and we are embarrassed that did in the first place.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I&#8217;m affected, what now?</span></p>
<p>Our support staff on the forums has jumped into action and provided manual and automated fixes for those affected. The simplest solution is to use the &#8216;adb sideload&#8217; tool to flash a working build. As the installer itself is meant for non-technical users, we have created standalone executables (.exe) for each affected device. For those more keen on flashing the fix themselves, individual zips are also available.</p>
<p>Instructions and downloads for the fixes are available on our <a href="http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/88951-sideload-fix-for-recent-s3-and-s4-ota-update-issue/">Forum support page for this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Our deepest apologies for all the trouble that this has caused those affected, it won&#8217;t happen again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the release of CM 10.2.0 we end our foray into Android 4.3-land and planned releases based on that code. We will of course continue to provide hot-fixes, security patches and similar as needed. The device roster for this initial run includes all devices that received an RC1.</p>
<p>Echoing the <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/cyanogenmod-10-2-rc1">RC1 post</a>, <strong>make sure you update your third party addon zips</strong>. As a cursory note, for those of you coming from 10.1 or earlier, if you notice your Phone app reports as &#8216;not installed': simply remove the shortcut and re-add it from your application drawer.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve done with similar &#8216;end of branch&#8217; releases, this marks the point where the team will shift focus solely to CM 11 and Android 4.4 (KitKat) code. CM 10.2 nightlies will continue and as we ramp up CM 11 nightlies, device maintainers will signal which devices are ready to make that jump as well. Whether you prefer stable, almost stable or bleeding edge, all of you will have something to flash very soon!</p>
<p>Some additional administrative items. We&#8217;ll soon be retiring the ICS branches from the nightly rotation. There are less and less changes going into that branch, and with CM 11 nightlies on the horizon, it makes more sense to task the buildbots to actively changing branches instead (ie 10.0 and above).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also made a change to the release tagging process. For those of you who like to build for releases for yourself, note that all but the device repositories themselves are being built off of a new &#8216;stable/cm-10.2&#8242; branch in our source. Think of &#8216;cm-10.2&#8242; as the development branch and &#8216;stable/cm-10.2&#8242; as the release branch. Just pass the relevant arguments on sync to decide which you prefer. This change has no impact to gerrit or any code contributions.</p>
<p>Happy Flashing</p>

<p>A special &#8220;Thank You&#8221; to all of the beta testers, which at current count, is a community with over 7000 members. The reception and demand we&#8217;ve received for the installer shows the value in breaking down the barrier to entry that we sought to address. We will continue to work on supporting additional devices beyond the initial set, but we are proud to say that we are supporting the majority of flagship models currently on the market. For a list of currently supported models, please see our <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/CyanogenMod_Installer">Installer wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>After this release, we will also refresh the layout and design of our Download Portal, making it easier to find the builds for your devices. By visiting <a href="http://download.cyanogenmod.org/">download.cyanogenmod.org</a>, you will be able to intuitively filter and search for your device, and select whether you would like the latest stable or nightly build. Gone are the days of having to memorize your device&#8217;s code-name. Keep an eye out for that update.</p>
<p>Update: A forum and JIRA project are now available as well. <a href="Support pages for the CM Installer  In addition to the wiki page with general information and some quick troubleshooting tips, we have created a forum for you to interact with the folks behind the CM Installer for any issues you may encounter.   Being a CM project, we are also accepting logs and your feedback via our JIRA install.   http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/81800-welcome-to-cyanogenmod-installer-forum/">Check out the introduction post</a>.</p>
