		<description><![CDATA[Let  me try to explain it to you again, it detail, so you&#039;ll understand it: There are two options to pre-install apps:

(1) put in /system/app - You can remove them with root manually, but they&#039;ll come back after an update.

(2) put in /system/vendor - The app gets then copied to /data/app on the initial boot - You can &quot;uninstall&quot; those apps, but that won&#039;t actually free any space. That&#039;s what Cyanogen OS does for Boxer, Boxer Calendar and others.

Apparently, you don&#039;t like the 1st choice. But the second choice does not provide any benefit over disabling apps, because the file remains in the /system partition. It&#039;s just eye candy to make users feel better.

It is also unclear if you even refer to Cyanogen OS or CyanogenMod. 


You asked &quot;allow me to uninstall all the pre loaded apps from cyanogenmod&quot; - which you can do manually with (1). Offering (2) here does not make sense, since you already have (1).


Cyanogen OS, without root, is a different matter. It would be an option to choose (2) here, but that&#039;s just a perceived advantage for the user, there is no real advantage compared to disabling the apps: In any case, the app stays in the /system partition (you also cannot modify /system without root and without breaking OTAs).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jesus man, I haven&#039;t met someone as bulkheaded as you. 1. Cyanogen is an ROM, can be installed without root on your phone and replaces all stock apps including bloat ware. However they add their own apps becoming the bloat ware themselves. 2. CyanogenMod the ROM version that needs root to be installed also has some stock apps that also call the be uninstalled forcing you to have 2 versions of every app, CyanogenMod apps and Google Apps. And you can&#039;t uninstall the cyanogen ones. I don&#039;t care whether you like them or not, they should allow them to be uninstalled. The purpose of installing ROMs is to be rid of bloat ware. As it stands, Cyanogen and CyanogenMod just replace Manufacturer and Carrier bloat ware with their own useless shit copies of Google Apps. What pisses me off is that they&#039;re the only major ROM left after Paranoid Android closed shop and so they&#039;re probably the only alternative to people who don&#039;t want to buy Nexii. ]]></description>
