		<description><![CDATA[This may not be the proper place for it, but I was just reading through your site and wanted to extend the most sincere &quot;Thank You&quot; I believe I have ever given. I recently Installed CM7 on my quickly aging DX(2init) and it breathed life into it better than the day I turned it on for the first time. I only recently took the GB OTA update, and it destroyed my battery life. I was lucky if I could pull it off the charger and make it to my car to go to work before I was at 90% (no shit). CM7 has given me better battery life than FroYo ever did, and with the V6 Supercharger script (which I honestly wasnt sure if it would work with CM), and keeping BGdata off til needed, I am getting EASILY a full 24 hours out of my phone, under medium use, and 8-10 hrs under heavy use (lots of text/talk/email/reddit). On the issue of whether or not you charge for an app, I will gladly pay whatever you ask for any app you make, CM is the shit!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why not switch from nightly updates to every other day or every 3 days?  I&#039;d also suggest using torrents to save on bandwidth, but not sure how this would work if using ROM Manager to update instead of downloading and moving the ROM to and SD card via usb.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wouldn&#039;t it be a solution to distribute a VM-Image, which user can download and install on their system. For the user this is a blackbox, you have root access to the VM and the VM calls a server every X Minutes and asks for build-jobs. The build jobs which are offered will loop through all devices. The VM compiles and sents the result back via SSH/FTP etc. You wait until there are N identical builds e.g. same hash, then publish this build as nightly and delete the according open build job. 
So you don&#039;t have to care if one special machine is online and I&#039;m quite sure there will be hundrets of user who support this project by providing cpu-usage of their systems. If the build time is arround 45minutes on a octalcore with 24GB Rams, I would bet that you have builds of 50+ devices in less than two hours including down- and upload of the files.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am using a recent nightly build for the Motorola Backflip. 7-11162011-nightly to be exact. Thank you much for making it so I am not stuck with the ancient Android release that AT&amp;T had be me stuck with! I can even do the Netflix app, although I need to tweak something so the audio and video are in synch.

You guys rock!]]></description>
