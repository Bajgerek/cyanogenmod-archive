I understand the camera is a pretty major part of the hardware, but with everything else functioning smoothly and properly can it be added to the unnoficial ports list?

		<description><![CDATA[As a layman I state as follows

I don&#039;t understand what is official or unofficial! A little more clear explanation my help people like me use these methods directly, but have no idea of what it is all about!

I recently updated siii mini to 4.4.2 using techbeasts method, but at the end I saw it was called unofficial. 

Now only I see about 4.4.4 in your site and about the TWO versions namely official and the other.

As S III mini comes under unsupported devices in your installer site, I wonder whether I can update to 4.4.4 using your downloads, but without wiping anything! 

My doubt is because I used an unofficial version and so whether that qualifies for the NO wipe method!

Whatever it is, hats off to the entire community of you developers, from a man from nuts and bolts area, as serving others seems to be your main output, whether intended or not! 

Congrats and keep it up. Thank you all.]]></description>
