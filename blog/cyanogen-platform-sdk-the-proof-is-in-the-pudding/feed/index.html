		<description><![CDATA[Hi, CM.  I&#039;m looking for a product that allows me to access and route LTE Internet to Wi-Fi, BT or USB interfaces on IPv4 + IPv6 directly in my car so that the children can use Internet on their phones, Nintendo DS, etc. while driving and so that I can access my DR650GW-2CH remotely or receive alerts when events are detected (hit + run, motion, etc.).  I&#039;m having difficulties finding any devices that actually meet my needs and was wondering if CM has considering building a ROM that allows any Android to function purely as an IPv4 + IPv6 Modem and Router.  All of the necessary hardware is already built into the phone. I imagine this would require gutting Android&#039;s UI.  All of the devices that I&#039;m seeing on the market cost $200.00 to $400.00, they are limited to IPv4 and power-inefficient.  I&#039;m already doing something similar to this, but my system only works when my personal phone is connected to the car&#039;s power and BT; I&#039;m using Tasker to automatically enable Wi-Fi Tethering when my Android is powered and connected to BT (as double affirmation that the phone is in the car and powered so that GPS, BT and Wi-Fi don&#039;t drain the battery).  Is this something CM has considered and if so, when can we expect the CM Slim OS to become available?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cyanogenmod does have their own versions of some apps, like Contacts/People, but most of the apps on CM are just stock AOSP ones that Cyanogenmod, apart from compatibility, hasn&#039;t done much work on. More than half of those ceased development when Google made their own version (Browser -&gt; Chrome, Calendar -&gt; Google Calendar, Dialer -&gt; Hangouts, etc). Of course those are going to be ugly and outdated.

The beauty of Cyanogenmod is its open source and completely free as in freedom. If you want the HTC or Samsung apps, or just a skin that makes the AOSP default apps look and feel like them without having the privacy invasion that usually comes with proprietary apps, chances are you can find it on the XDA forums. You might have to flash a zip (like the gapps zip), even if its only a skin and not a completely new set of apps, but it can be done. Like most Linux distros, Cyanogenmod isn&#039;t as beautiful or full featured as many of us would like from a fresh install. The reason you go open source in the first place is so you can do whatever you want to it, isn&#039;t it?]]></description>
