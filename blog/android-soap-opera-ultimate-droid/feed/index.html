		<description><![CDATA[I read the whole &quot;soap opera&quot; issue, Cyanogen vs UltimateDroid on many sites and thought I might review. I have my A++ and unix/linux cert,I also write (with my 10 year old son ,he is a firecracker lol) code.I have a rooted droid and tested all the roms I could find. I found cyanogen and UD the best.  I so wanted to root for cyanogen because of the real complaints it sited, I wanted to make it my daily driver, but the fact is this is the nature of open source; we can use your code however and whenever we like, you can yell &#039;site me, mention my name&#039; all you want but it does not change the reality (changelog lets go back to xerox 1973 nobody mentions me boohoo). sorry I gave each rom a week on my phone and cyanogen lost. I don&#039;t want buy Setcpu if I don&#039;t need it, I like the integrated home (ADW) that UD offers,I don&#039;t want the find a smoke theme  (or any other theme) for my release then update crap (sorry not the right one lets boot loop for a while then if you know how x to recovery and flash )  BlackDroid has it right UI perfect, integration perfect, easy to understand almost noob proof. The best damn Droid rom out there. Cyanogen stop crying and make a better rom.

P.S  cyanogen came in second only in my opinion and I flash between the two, Cyanogen still rocks try it for yourself and see. I just prefer UD you might like it better and for the noobs try zen and ShadowRom both great!]]></description>
