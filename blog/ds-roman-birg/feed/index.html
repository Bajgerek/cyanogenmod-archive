		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t switch to CyanogenMod. There is no guarantee that your phone will be supported in the future, too. For example, I bought a Sony device because it was well supported in the past. But just a few weeks later, support was dropped. The developers decided for some reason to not release stable versions any more. Only nightly builds with broken WLAN, battery drain, lots of crashes and so on were released. See the post by Herbert above. Now I&#039;m stuck at CM11 (Android 4.4). I would recommend to just stay at stock firmware, root your phone and do the modifications you want. In terms of rooting, I can recommend Sony, they are very community-friendly, allowing you to unlock the bootloader easily. Just don&#039;t switch to CyanogenMod. Worst open source community ever.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure what you mean.  Each device has a modem version that corresponds to different versions of Android.  Google your device plus modem and you&#039;ll find a list (probably on XDA) of modems.  When people experience connectivity issues when updating from one to another (not using a stock OTA) then it&#039;s because they also didn&#039;t update their modem.  CM cannot give out Samsung/HTC/Moto modems in their code but you&#039;re free to flash it yourself.]]></description>

Keeping on topic, I found this post interesting.  Thanks for the work guys! I have certainly been having fun and learning new things.]]></description>
