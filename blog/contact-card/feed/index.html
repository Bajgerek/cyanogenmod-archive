		<description><![CDATA[Worst part about AOSP is that it collapses multiple phone numbers and only shows one, requiring that the user press &quot;show all&quot;. Please either disable this collapsing, or have the contact card remember whether or not you want to see all phone numbers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1.) Explain me how can designers (frontend guys) help at fixing bugs, most of which are so deep in the code that requires hardcore review by backend coders to understand what&#039;s wrong.
2.) Did you pay for that unstable snapshot? No. So CyanogenMod doesn&#039;t owe you anything, right? If you don&#039;t like it - just go back to your carriers 4.2 jb.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am the Product Manager for the Dialer project.  Thank you all for your feedback.  Its very much appreciated.  Below are some answers to the common feedback.  Sorry if I missed anyone.


1.  Hi Res Images:  We are working to develop two layouts for different size images.  Design work is already underway.  Any takers on implementation if we supply the redlines?
2.  No edit:  Many of you commented on no edit.  The images above are for contacts not in your contact database and therefore the second from the left icon shows Add Contact.  If the contact were already in your contact database then that icon would be an Edit Contact button.  Edit is obviously a common feature and we would not remove it.  
3.  Clipboard options:  We will take a look at the clipboard options.  Long press should bring these up.  If not, I will file a bug.
4.  Button ordering: Will test the current order and continue to work on optimizing the layout.  Every use is different and one of our design goals is to make functionality more obvious to most users.  Overflows are fine but its makes features invisiable to those new to Cyanogen devices.]]></description>
