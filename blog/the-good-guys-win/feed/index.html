		<description><![CDATA[I am writing this on my newly rooted my touch slide.. yay. Look I don&#039;t know the whole story but I will say this.

 You people who think open source is just about a free lunch, annoy me. I am not dev maybe someday soon, but not right now. The little bit of code work that I have done in javascript and php has just been me knowing just enought to change the code to make it do what I want. Since its not my code to begin with I always give credit to created the original.

Part of being in this community is acknowledging each of our work towards the community goals. I have had writings stolen from me and it is not fun when some duchebag takes credit some something you poured you time and dedication into. 

In the end hashes don&#039;t lie. 

If someone is going to use your work wouldn&#039;t you like them to give you credit?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know why there is so much upholding for Black Droid (Greg Martin) at all in the community. He simply takes another persons piece of work (no he can&#039;t compile or code at all), sticks a theme on it and calls it his own. He then offers support to the community building his image as the good dev / samaritan.

If I didn&#039;t have to actually do the dev work I would be all about being the &quot;PR and support&quot; guy on the forums answering all the questions and helping people with issues setting up &quot;my&quot; rom. If all the devs gave this much time we wouldn&#039;t have any new developments. If Black Droid did some honest dev work we wouldn&#039;t see a release each week, we wouldn&#039;t see him answering every post on the forum.

Why not instead of stealing others work just sit back and help the community in the best way you possible can? Just be a supporter of a rom and help others as you do now. You don&#039;t have to steal work and try to create some image of yourself to help others, this really just hurts the dev community. No one appreciates others just stealing their work (myself included), claiming it as their own hard work, and on top of that giving no credit either (face slap). Just because it&#039;s open source doesn&#039;t mean respect and morals are omitted as well.

Ninjineer the problem is he didn&#039;t change anything the source code and probably never will anytime soon. He wouldn&#039;t be worthy of any merits imo until he&#039;s completely honest with the entire community (including his followers). Step down already Greg and do what you know how to do best, support the community. Give a true honest apology don&#039;t keep covering tracks your just making yourself look lower and lower in more and more peoples eyes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People tested and posted bugs, because in turn, developers would help them with issues they had.  Backs were scratched, all around.  BD never set misplaced expectations, he simply upheld the expectations that have been set in every single open source environment I&#039;ve seen.  (Mostly Linux)

If he changed one thing in that entire source code, and reposted, and credited where credit was due, we wouldn&#039;t be having this discussion.  I still think he deserves merit for reaching out to the community the way he did,  Congratulations to the real developers who worked hard on the code, but my thanks goes to the guy that helps us work out the issues we have, day one.

We can agree to disagree, I guess?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It looks like Pete has some interesting contributions to this topic. It&#039;s good to see devs respecting eachother.
peteralfonso.com

@Ninjineer - BD has a bunch of spare time. Probably because it doesn&#039;t take him as long to slap his name on other people&#039;s work as it does to actually work on code. See, that&#039;s what the REAL devs are doing when they don&#039;t have the time to help people wipe their butts.

Are you serious about what Cyan has &quot;done to the community over pissing rights?&quot; If you keep seeing &quot;lax response...&quot; WTF? You are complaining about the hard FREE work that others are doing for you?

People like you drag down any community with your unrealistic expectations and selfish, bitter attitudes. Most of the people on those forums don&#039;t even take the time to search the board before they jump in asking the dev some stupid question that&#039;s been asked 50 times in the same thread. It is these people (like you) who BD has no problem whoring himself out to for donations... another reason why he is a tool, and the ONLY reason why people like him.

Honestly, the more people like BD that are out there, the worse off the &quot;community&quot; will be and if you can&#039;t see that then you are part of the problem. All he&#039;s done is feed your misplaced expectations, and now you are dumping them off on devs that actually do the work that he was posing on. Pathetic.

Note: I didn&#039;t know jack about android before I got my phone 3 months ago, I&#039;ve flashed just about every rom out there, and I&#039;ve never once thought of bothering a dev for anything, and wouldn&#039;t expect any of them to respond if I did.

The community is for helping eachother and posting bugs, not bothering devs. It&#039;s called dignity and respect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will give BD one thing: according to everyone I&#039;ve spoken to, he was always VERY available and responsive to people who had questions and needed help.  Much more so than the other devs.

Are you other devs ready to nut up now that you&#039;ve ousted him?  If I keep seeing lax response, I will thoroughly be ashamed of what you&#039;ve done to the community over pissing rights.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER HAD A JOB? THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT 98% OF ALL BOSSES DO! HELL, THE GET PAID FOR IT! &quot;

Yes, 98% of all bosses do this. That&#039;s because YOU ARE PAID to give your company ownership of your code. It&#039;s standard procedure when you WORK FOR SOMEONE ELSE. Cyanogen doesn&#039;t work for BD, and vice versa. No money changed hands between them. Invalid argument.

Hey man, nobody said anything about demolishing anything. From the get go it has already been agreed to that if BD admitted to copying and did some crediting right form the very beginning, it would&#039;ve all gone away.

The problem here is that despite being outed, BD still denied copying anything (and he was in turn defended by a few people here. Good on him). Only when more proof mounted did the ROM start having some sweeping credits. 

Hey, it&#039;s perfectly alright to be dishonest in any situation. You reap what you sow.]]></description>
