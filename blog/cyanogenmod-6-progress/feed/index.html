		<description><![CDATA[hii all,

i&#039;m  pugky from indonesia. currently i used nexian journey a.k.a Motorola Greco, Orange Boston, GigaByte G1305 Codfish, Apanda A60, WellcoM A88, Vibo A688, Cincinnati Bell Blaze f800, Commtiva Z71, Muchtel A1, Chinavision Excalibur.

last night i already try to use update-cm-6.1.0-RC4-Z71-signed.zip as my froyo installer to root (or u call it flash?), i don&#039;t know which the right one. basically i already get in to the froyo by used that firmware. 

At the beginning, it seem running smoothly, but when i want to run the g apps in my phone, i forget to active my 3G (hsdpa) network. meanwhile, on my phone already asked me to register my google account on it. but after i try to get back, it not allowed me to get out for active my hsdpa network. (btw, i use hsdpa network becoz in my friend&#039;s house didn&#039;t have wifi network

back to the story, after that, i try continue to key in my account, but the device said i need to continue the registration via wifi network, did i don&#039;t have a chance to register via hsdpa network?

what should i do then? 
meanwhile, even i already try to set my APN network in froyo, the device still can&#039;t detect my network source...

based on what happen, so i try to reboot the older rom, it mean the official eclair network to my phone, but after that, i found some trouble in the ori rom, my wifi didn&#039;t work at all....

is there any solution for those trouble? please help me, bcoz i&#039;m so newbie here but i&#039;m so in love with android from the first time i saw and heard this OS.....

thanks guys and so sorry if my comment disturbing your time....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I installed cyanagen 6.0 but now I&#039;m trying to use a kernel BC I heard it will make my phone run faster. So I downloaded ps3 something and also a few other ones but it freezes my phone up on start up. Any advise on what kernel I should use for driod moto1?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also rooted a Credo HTC Hero and installed cyanogen.  It&#039;s so so so much better.  I was almost ready to get rid of this phone and go back to AT&amp;T.

Get the word out.  Tell people who are considering Credo that the root can be done.  This is imperative if Credo is going to sway iPhone users away from AT&amp;T.  If only they could announce it officially.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oops.  Sorry!

I was assuming that because I never found any posts claiming to have success with romming a Credo HTC Hero, that it couldn&#039;t be done.  I took a chance last night, and rooted and successfully rommed CM6.  It took about 10% of the time as my research into seeing if it had been done before.

My, god, this thing runs so much better.  No sluggishness, and ability to force roaming when I&#039;m in a fringe Sprint area.

Thank you so much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wish someone would make a mod...  *any* mod, for the Hero as delivered via Credo Mobile.

I switched to Credo because I was tired of my monthly bill going to support the US Tea Party movement, and other unnerving corporate efforts (the AT&amp;T/iPhone cabal being the worst).

Alas, it seems that most hackers and programmers don&#039;t really care about the politics beneath their gadget choices.  So I wait for the tepid, non-Froyo official, upgrade to dribble down from HTC to my little carrier.

Sigh.]]></description>
