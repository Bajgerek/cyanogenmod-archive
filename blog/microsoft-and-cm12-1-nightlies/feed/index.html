		<description><![CDATA[What if the reason Microsoft is expanding into other mobile platforms is exactly *because* they are in 3rd place behind Android and iOS?  Whoever you are when you are 1st place in popularity for something you feel less incentive to innovate (&quot;resting on your laurels&quot; as they say).  I assume this is a part of Microsoft&#039;s plan to try to become #1 itself: by offering it&#039;s services/apps in as many platforms as possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They &quot;lose&quot; money in order to keep up appearances that they are not as large and monopolistic as they are and this keeps the federal investigators away and from them getting labeled a monopoly.  It may look like tons of lost money, but with Bill Gates always being in the top 3 richest people in the world anytime a list is made I can guarantee you they are continuing to make WAY more money than they are losing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LoL, if anything this is M$ getting it&#039;s foot in the door of an Android developer house that&#039;s having potentially business ending issues.  if anything especially if they begin small by getting their core apps running within Android ecosystem then they can sit back and if Cyanogen goes the way of the likes of Netscape then M$ has a really cheap and easy ripe picking to take and gain the most well known put together ROM development house Android has.  If this happens then they have a large chunk of Android talent to use and that more than likely is the shape this is taking (either that or like when M$ loaned apple money back in the day it&#039;s wasn&#039;t out of the goodness of their heart.  They are getting to the point where they can be accused of being a monopoly and using unfair business practices on smaller companies.  If they instead inject money in to other &quot;competitors&quot; than the feds can&#039;t come investigating them and they can continue to do whatever they wish).  So I find it super interesting in reading your comments about M$ as they begin to sound like M$ is some small start up looking to make it&#039;s mark.  This is definitely not the case I ASSURE you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, the boxer app and a couple others are built in such a way the OS itself depends on them so if you attempt to remove it even with root privileges the OS will either not work or will constantly throw error messages.  You can not remove apps that the system framework directly depends on to be there without negative consequences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not sure what all the hubub is about, but I currently use MyPhoneExplorer to &quot;integrate&quot; my android with my Win10 PC and Laptop and I wouldn&#039;t be too upset if Microsoft-friendly functionality was somehow added to CM.


If I did have a problem, I could drop into a shell and rm -rf the shit, and/or restrict it completely with XPrivacy. Devs would fork CM with Microsoft removed and people would vote with his/her feet. 

I&#039;m not completely in the loop with what is going on...but...
It&#039;s not like we haven&#039;t the tools or human capital to handle it, guys and gals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ROFLMAO, and you think Microsoft hasn&#039;t been doing what you are scared of Google doing for years already?!  Why do you think IE has been litigated through court and forced to become a removable application when M$ first tried to make it mandatory?  How about all the small companies M$ has bought out and shuttered just because they were scared of the possible competition?  How about with Windows 10 doing full on background analytical collection without hardly any notice to the user upon install?  How about the banner ads they now force on you EVERY time you click to open the start menu in Windows 10?  

I am not knocking your overall statement to be careful of large corporations who love to collect all your personal data without you realizing it and selling it to the highest bidder, but if you think Microsoft is going to somehow look out for you and Google is the corporation to be wary of let me let you in on a little secret...  MOST ALL LARGE CORPORATIONS ARE THE SAME NONE CARE ABOUT YOU AND THEY ARE ALL OUT TO MAKE MONEY my friend.]]></description>
