		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree, many people in India or the Arabic nations would not be impressed nor would Muslims worldwide. It&#039;s easy enough to download and install as I have. 

Great rooms. Wish I&#039;d had the courage and the knowledge to flash earlier.

		<description><![CDATA[About this subject, and more technical question. I am rather new to Android, own an htc magic since 2 weeks ago. Flashed it with CyanogenMod 6.1 (which includes the controversial wallpaper), and I want to remove it. How should I do it?

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Damn. Just realized the wallpaper is gone. I scrolled all the way to the end and got a picture of some duckish things.

I&#039;ll miss that picture... well, there&#039;s always Google. So what&#039;s the fuss about?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personally, I liked the wallpaper. I remember when I first found it, I put it on my phone and showed my co-worker. We had a good laugh, and then I changed it to a more personal picture because I&#039;m not in high school anymore and that&#039;s not the background I really want. I would have voted to keep it though. Regardless, the bottom line is that cyanogenmod is AWESOME!  Cyanogenmod has allowed me to take control of my HTC Hero and turn it into a usable phone. It has enabled me to purchase inexpensive but powerful hardware like the Viewsonic G Tablet and actually make it usable. I love Cyanogenmod! And I&#039;m thrilled that instead of one person who might eventually get sick of making this great rom, it&#039;s a team of developers willing to dedicate their time to keep it updated. Not only that, but a team of people who care about being professional and not wanting to offend even a small percentage of their userbase. Keep up the great work cyanogenmod, and THANK YOU!]]></description>
