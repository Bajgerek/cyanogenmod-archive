		<description><![CDATA[CM 11 and 12 not being finished is a good thing.  If you have an older device that can&#039;t upgrade to 13 it is nice to know CM is still maintaining KK and LP.  Not everyone can afford to upgrade phones every year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Turns out CM updated to Marshmallow quickly for SOME devices (G855).  And no it is not a major upgrade, if anything Google just messed up some stuff.

- Camera is back to having some connection issues.

- Can&#039;t write to external SD cards, AGAIN, and the new format as internal doesn&#039;t work.

- Reworked Quick Settings tiles?! Really, this is what Google spent their time on? The new format is terrible in my opinion. 

- Rearranged Settings for no apparent reason. 

- Can&#039;t separate notification and ring volume. 

- Connecting a USB cable to transfer files is now a two step process; you have to tell the OS you want to transfer files EVERY TIME. 

- Bluetooth is sketchy.  I have to forget and re-pair my car stereo pairing every time. 

- Battery drain is maybe a little higher.

All my App Store apps work fine.  Except you can&#039;t use SuperSU any longer. 

I can&#039;t comment on the things I never use; all Google apps, phone, contacts, calendar, messaging, etc. I like my third party apps better so I don&#039;t know if the improved these or broke them. 

Overall, it seems a little faster.  Over time, I&#039;m sure CM will fix some of these shortcomings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What about an CM-11 release for the October 5th update?
&quot;For our stable release users...&quot; sounded like you&#039;d be planning to release such an update, like you did in the beginning of September.

Especially a fixed release for the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini (Intl) / serranoltexx would help me a lot.]]></description>
