		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using a One plus one.  Every build since 14 takes out my phone.  Boots but all Google functions/apps error out.
Gapps needs to be reinstalled with every nightly build along with lots of other apps.
Last night&#039;s build disabled all functionality so had to roll back to Dec. 2 build.
I realise the One plus one is not on the officially supported list but this level of incompatibility was a disappointment

		<description><![CDATA[Just found Cyanogenmod 14 for my Moto G,  installed and working, awesome.
Its pretty obvious why the official Android software gets dropped or delayed.
Consider the benefits of getting a new phone.  Apart from more powerful processor its about the operating system being new and paying out cash.
Now with this update my Moto G is brilliant, just doesn&#039;t have NFC or fast charging.
My recommendation to anyone is revitalize your old phone and save a load of money on contracts or new phone prices, or buy an older model.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is Sony is the same company when you root Z3 you lose DRM and camera quality. Which force people not to root? 

Sony is the company which is making same style face phone with huge too bottom bezel phone, note 5 size but only smaller screen phone. 

Dude if you bought sony phone then be prepared for no support at many levels. Not just from CM. 

For CM if they make s software for us fine, if they don&#039;t make, one can&#039;t complain. 

If for CM you are beta tester, they haven&#039;t beg you. It&#039;s your choice and you installed it for your gain not got someone else. ]]></description>
