			<p>DEF CON 24 is officially in the books, so what better time to release a new CM snapshot, full of new features and security updates? These releases were branched on August 1st, 2016 (branch stable/cm-13.0-ZNH5Y) and bring our snapshot releases up from Android 6.0.1 r17 to Android 6.0.1 r61.</p>
<p>The first thing you should notice is our new custom boot &amp; dexopt screen, getting rid of that bright white for something a bit prettier and informative to look at while your phone upgrades; AMOLED users rejoice! Shoutout to Asher, Joey and Alexander M. for the awesome work!</p>
<p>On the features front, the full change log is linked off below, but we&#8217;ll call out some of the big ticket items:</p>
<ul>

<p>Full change log: http://pastebin.com/ptatg6kh</p>
<p>Speaking of security, let&#8217;s touch on a few items. First, this release incoporates every Android security bulletin this year to-date, with a reported security patch level of August 5th, see https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2016-08-01.html and prior bulletins on what this entails.</p>
<p>Second, many users have likely read about the Quadrooter vulnerability coming out of DEF CON. Here, we have a bit of bad news. Of the four reported CVEs, we&#8217;ve been able to plug the ones that affected OSS code (ie the kernel), specifically CVE-2016-2059 and CVE-2016-5340. However, some of the reported vulnerabilities lie within OEM binary blobs, meaning we don&#8217;t have source access to resolve them.</p>
<p>So what does this mean? Unfortunately, for many devices we may never be able to completely resolve the outstanding issues, as OEMs are unlikely to release updated blobs across the generations of devices CM 13.0 supports, many of which were end of lifed on Lollipop or even earlier. We&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to remind you to be smart about where you source your applications, whether the Play Store, a FOSS equivelent or elsewhere on the internet &#8211; we&#8217;ve done our part to ensure the security of your device, but this and other parts are entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Builds will be rolling out as they complete from the build bots, with today&#8217;s roster below. As a reminder, you can flash this safely on top of the previous CM 13.0 ZNH0E releases without wiping. For further flashing instructions, see the wiki and the <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/cm-13-0-release-1">previous release post&#8217;s information</a>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our last Developer Spotlight with Roman Birg. This time around we are moving the spotlight over to Christopher N. Hesse. He is responsible for several devices including the controversial Exynos devices like the Galaxy Note 4 and the Galaxy Tab S2. Developer Spotlights are a public nudge of appreciation to the developers that tirelessly work and contribute to a greater cause for a better OS.</span></p>
<p><b>Hi Chris, how is your day today? Welcome to your first Developer Spotlight! Can you give us an introduction to yourself? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>Hi Steve, my day has been great so far, thanks! My name is Christopher Noel Hesse, I’m 20 years old and live in Germany, where I’m studying at University at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m working in the automotive industry on my non-University days and enjoy working on the Android platform there as well.</span></p>
<p><b>It does not surprise me one bit that you tinker with cars as well as smartphones. What are you currently studying in college?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>I have been studying business informatics for two years now and hope to acquire my first degree by 2017.</span></p>
<p><b>By the time you graduate you will have quite a bit of experience under your belt. What got you into tinkering with Android and open source?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>I think it was the desire to actually be able to do what I want with a device I paid for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad situation with (major) Android version updates was another factor. I consider it quite funny seeing how the situation is still about as bad today, whereas Apple is supporting their devices at least twice as long and well on average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why I am an avid advocate of open source software. We need to be able to keep their devices alive when the OEM decides to drop it or our planet will drown in garbage soon.</span></p>
<p><b>Well, for the same price you get similar ‘premium hardware’. Apple has tried to set a precedent of expectation for software updates and support. It’s an awesome and sad thing at the same time. We have the community to continue support while the company getting paid for the hardware sets a short update path.</b></p>
<p><b>What was your first device and how long was it supported by the manufacturer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>My first (Android) device was the Samsung Galaxy 3 (GT-I5800, not the S3), which came with Android Eclair (2.1) and was supported for about a year if I remember correctly &#8211; at least it got the update to Froyo (2.2) which was a big deal at that time because it brought important improvements such as the Dalvik Just In Time (JIT) compiler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The community achieved an almost usable Gingerbread AOSP build and someone even continued to work on Ice Cream Sandwich (by the time I had moved on to a Sony Xperia S).</span></p>
<p><b>So you received an additional (nearly) two years of support for this device from the community? That is awesome. </b><b>I started with the Motorola Droid on Verizon, which developers supported up to Ice Cream Sandwich. What devices are you currently maintaining and do you think current hardware limitations will allow for longer community support?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>It really is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sadly never owned a Motorola device and apparently I’m late to the party, with Lenovo now owning their mobile division. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am currently responsible for the Exynos5 and Exynos7 platforms and I maintain the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Exynos family, the Galaxy Note 5 family as well as the Galaxy Tab S2 family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the funny thing is that all our current Exynos5/7 board support code is based off an Android Kitkat BSP release from the hardkernel guys, with tons of our own fixes and updates to it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means I am right now supporting devices running the latest Android Marshmallow (cm-13) using drivers that were designed for an iteration that was released several years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m quite confident I can support the Exynos 5430 and upwards for quite a while still.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You are a bigger key figure in the upbringing of a difficult platform than most people understand. Thanks for the hard work and dedication.</b></p>
<p><b>How is it working with the other components like camera and touchscreen on the Samsung devices? Is it just as difficult as the board?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>The difference in working with the two subsystems you pointed out is actually night and day on the devices I worked on so far. As for touchscreen, the kernel driver (which they are obliged to release as part of the GPL) is usually all you need and in most cases, it is just a simple Inter-Integrated-Circuit (i2c) bus that needs to be looked at for bug fixing and improvements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The camera however, is a different cup of tea. We are still struggling with the Exynos7 camera hardware to this day, because the user space drivers play a big role here as well. Samsung’s kernel space components, namely the Multi Format Codec (MFC) and others, provide well documented interfaces we can work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Android platform drivers build on top of the Video4Linux (V4L2) architecture and are utterly complex with specific Exynos graphics format mappings and whatnot. All in all, working with Exynos specific subsystems can be a pain &#8211; but an unparalleled learning experience at the same time.</span></p>
<p><b>I figured as much when it comes to the intricacies of Samsung’s policies and hardware. Enough of the technicalities though. What do you find yourself doing on the other side of the phones? You said you work in the automotive realm, any hobbies of choice?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>My hobbies these days basically denote to spending as much time with my friends as I can, including going to the local beach, playing paintball or just roaming the German cities at night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I played football for about eight years, but never really got into it again after that. I do enjoy watching the European Championship and other sport events though. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, I also grew to like skiing and I definitely wish I could do it more often.</span></p>
<p><b>I have never had the opportunity to ski. It looks painful to wipe out with a bit less control than on a skateboard. </b></p>
<p><b>I find it amazing that you find time to also spend countless hours contributing to CM. Where did you pick this skill up and when did you start?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>I can only recommend trying it out, it’s awesome! <img src="http://cyanogenmod.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a good question and a hard one to answer actually. I guess it was by the time I went to school for the last two years when I got bored more and more each day, so I started hacking on the Lego Mindstorms NXT set I got a while back (not using the click-to-code interface) and soon after that wanting to modify my Android smartphone to run the latest and greatest iteration everyone was talking about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started by learning Java but soon came to the conclusion I’d need to dive into C and C++ as well to be able to be successful with Android development. In the last two years, I started picking up extended Java and C++ courses at the University but at the very beginning, my programming knowledge was self taught I guess.</span></p>
<p><b>I went as far as to learn some Java and Python, I ended up focusing on design and web work. Do you have anybody you looked up to in the Android community?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>I envy you web designers for I still think designing HTML pages using CSS is a mess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes I wish I could get into that topic as much as low level platform development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I looked up to Ethan Chen (Intervigil) for the most time, not necessarily because of the things he did for the community, but also the way how he did it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see him constantly pushing new patches to CyanogenMod (and Inc. probably), yet he still finds time to check in on the IRC channels and he’s always up for discussing all things Android and CM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, I always perceived him as an accessible, helpful and friendly source of knowledge, something that isn’t exactly prevalent in the Android open source community to this grade.</span></p>
<p><b>Ha, I wasn’t much of a designer, more of an organizer and apprentice, I always ask for input or another perspective.</b></p>
<p><b>Anything you want to say before we end this chat?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH:</strong> I’d like to take the opportunity to encourage more developers and enthusiasts to contribute to a large project like CyanogenMod to provide aftermarket support for awesome hardware, often left to be forgotten because of sub-par software. I know at least two really talented developers, working full time jobs at industry leaders such as Red Hat, who were trying to get more into Android development but were discouraged by the attitude of the community towards them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Words such as ‘kanging’ or others aren’t used nearly as often in other Linux communities as they are used in the Android one for example. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my opinion, fragmentation is a problem for Linux distributions as well, the more eyes you can get to look on a patchset, the better your code and overall software quality will be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel happy knowing the CyanogenMod community is steadily growing and new talents are joining constantly. It’s a great thing seeing all these people push code to the project daily and CM providing the infrastructure for a flawless experience (build servers, download servers, gerrit nodes, etc.).</span></p>
<p>It’s been a great experience for me so far and a steep learning curve, I can only hope to continue this awesome hobby for as long as possible. Cheers, and see you on the forum, or in the IRC chan!</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/ds-roman-birg">Developer Spotlight: Reminiscing with Roman Birg</a></h2>
			<time class="updated" datetime="2016-06-10T15:17:24+00:00" pubdate>June 10th, 2016 &bull; Written by <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/author/bsxtn" rel="author" class="fn">bsxtn</a></time>	
		</header>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a couple weeks since our last Developer Spotlight with Mike Bestas two weeks ago. This time around we are moving the spotlight over to Roman Birg. He is responsible for several repositories today at Cyanogen Inc., but is ultimately known for his work on AOKP (Android Open Kang Project). Developer Spotlights are a public nudge of appreciation to the developers that tirelessly work and contribute to a greater cause for a better OS.</span></p>
<p><b>Roman, nice to have you on here. How is life and the dream?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: Life is great! I’ve been living in Seattle with my girlfriend Dani for over two years now, and it has been amazing. We even got a chocolate lab who’s growing into a quite a fine doge (he had a lot of teenager energy). I can’t see myself leaving the PNW (Pacific North West), I love this place.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell us a bit about yourself, where do you come from and how did you start tinkering with code?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: Born in Russia &#8211; moved to Memphis, Tennessee when I was 7, where I stayed until I graduated college. Although I didn’t start programming until high school, I kind of always knew that’s what I wanted to do… there was just no easy way to get into it when I was younger (and on dial up at the time). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess I started with some small time website hacking. I remember in 6th grade, I downloaded the phpBB forum zip, and opening the zip and trying to make sense of the PHP files on the school Windows 2000 PC’s. I also had no idea how to “run” them, I definitely tried though. I stuck with it for a while and eventually I was at the point where I had to learn Flash to continue down the web development path. I did not continue down that path.</span></p>
<p><b>What was the first language you started with? And what was the first project you completed?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: My high school programming class started us out with Java, so I ran with that. Turned out it was the right call more or less &#8211; most of college courses stuck with Java as well. And then came Android (well, bytecode[smali] first for me). Since then I’ve been exploring other languages as many chances as I get, Java just doesn’t cut it alone anymore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What have you incorporated from working on AOKP while working at Cyanogen Inc.?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: A few features here and there (nav bar arrow keys I still use daily), and maybe my experience messing with quick settings? Mostly unicorn jokes though.</span></p>
<p><b>Not surprising, I am sure you rode in on one today.</b></p>
<p><b>What are you currently working on today?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: I’m working on a nasty NFC + Bluetooth beaming bug where an unsuccessful transfer could put the other device in a bad state and not able to receive future file/photo beams until a reboot… so much stuff going on the device at that time too, it’s pretty gnarly.</span></p>
<p><b>Bug hunts can lead to or help create other bugs. Also, messing with Bluetooth can be a nightmare.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>:  Are you suggesting I’ve introduced bugs before? Never!</span></p>
<p><b>You have been around for a while in the Android scene, what do you think big manufacturers need to improve or focus on to be a better device manufacturer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: Everyone is so focused on making the next huge product that will sell millions of phones. But no one is putting in the time or love to make a device that doesn’t feel rushed. Everyone always has to have the newest hottest hardware (I do too sometimes). It’s really hard to find a balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like if there was a _stellar_ phone out right now, that released with an MSM8974 (like the original OnePlus device), but it had the best camera on market, a fingerprint sensor, useful UI enhancement (CM anyone?), and proper LTE band support, I’d be all over it. You usually get two, maybe three out of four of those things, but never all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nexus devices are the closest thing to this for me, but as always, those are severely lacking in the camera department.</span></p>
<p><b>So do you think that is why everything feels ‘outsourced’ and ‘stamped/rehashed’?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: I think that’s a byproduct of OEMs iterating on designs they already have (or have seen working elsewhere). It’s expensive to make these things, and even more expensive to make them right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to see manufacturers not release a new flagship _every_ year. I’ll pick on Samsung here since they’re the easiest target. I think this is what makes them feel not brand-spankin’ new anymore. They’ll change out a tiny feature here and there every year, so it’s never a HUGE surprise what they announce next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I didn’t see Samsung for a year with a new flagship, and they came back the next year with a quality product, I would definitely think twice. I haven’t thought about buying a Samsung since the S3, which was just a stellar device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand there the business side of things to think of. If I was in Samsung’s position, I’d probably be doing something very similar. It’s generating them users and profit. The question is always about sustainability.</span></p>
<p><b>What device are you currently using as your daily driver?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: I’ve been using the Nexus 6P as my daily since it was released. It’s camera is decent for a Nexus device, but I’ve found that it really sucks at close up shots. I realize it’s a phone, but I’ve seen better.</span></p>
<p><b>I think that the camera is basically the most popular deciding factor for buyers today. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: It wasn’t for me. Definitely a big part though. I knew this thing wasn’t going to have the best camera (although it was advertised to have a better one, and that did factor into my decision). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the fingerprint unlock did it for me. It was between a 6P and a new Moto X. The fingerprint sensor was the biggest difference between the two (that I cared about) and I don’t regret the decision. I use it heavily throughout the day &#8211; when I know I need to use my phone, it’s ready to go by the time I’m looking at it.</span></p>
<p><b>I would have to concur. Security is at an all time paramount these days.</b></p>
<p><b>You have a ton of experience with the amount of devices you have been able to test. With the Android platform being pretty dominant in today&#8217;s industry, what advice would you give to upcoming developers?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: Write code. Don&#8217;t be scared of breaking stuff and dig in. I feel like that&#8217;s pretty standard advice, but if works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also it&#8217;s not always about *just* writing code &#8211; make sure your that code is actually solving a problem. It might be as small as a bug. The problem could even be learning to program! But it&#8217;s never about just sitting down at a computer for the sake of writing code.</span></p>
<p><b>Breaking starts way before fixing! I love that line!</b></p>
<p><b>Is there any developers you looked up to or reached out to while learning Android?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: I want to give a huge shout out to Faux123. It was the time of the LG G2, and he was doing his own kernels and AOSP builds, I took a stab and reached out to him for help because I was stuck… and to my surprise he replied back! He was very patient with me and I tried to extract as much knowledge from him as possible without being annoying. I don’t think I could have started AOKP without his prior help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coolest part was I got to meet him a few years later at the BBQ (and then again at the CM Dev summit last year). Cheers Paul!</span></p>
<p><b>Paul is a very skilled developer, I am pretty sure everyone who has flashed a Kernel has heard of him.</b></p>
<p><b>Anything else before we part ways and get back to work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: I just want to say thanks to all the other developers contributing to CM (and other ROMs!), you all have shown me the power of the open source community. It’s all about having fun and learning new things, and this is a great place to do both.</span></p>

			<p><em>Tapping into my inner Balmer with the post title</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;re queuing up releases across three branches this evening, releasing into the wild CM 11.0-security, 12.0-security and our very first 12.1 release. As always, these releases are being marked as &#8216;known good&#8217; by their maintainer, and signed-off individually. This means that not every CM device will receive a release &#8211; only those marked as &#8216;Good to go&#8217; by the maintainer.</p>
<p>The 11.0 and 12.0 builds are security releases built on top of the last <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/releases-11-12-final">CM11/12.0 releases</a>, modified to include the recent security disclosures, including the vulnerabilities in Stagefright. Users of the previous 11/12.0 release builds are encouraged to update. Users of 11.0/12.0 weeklies (nightlies) will see no net change, and need not update.</p>
<p>The CM12.1 release marks our first Android 5.1.1 release which brings our IMAP idle support, SDK v1 release and the security fixes mentioned previously.</p>
<p>If you are updating to any of these builds, please pay close attention that the CM release version and the version of your third party installs (kernels, mods, gapps, etc) are compatible.</p>
<p>This is a substantial amount of releases, so bear with the build-bots as they go through the list. Should there be any hiccups in the process, we&#8217;ll resolve them tomorrow; for now, we&#8217;re going to go grab a beer or three.</p>

			<p>Welcome to another Developer Spotlight, a short Q &amp; A with community staff. This is a small spectacle of a much larger picture that we focus on to recognize the many talented developers who contribute to one of the largest community driven open source projects around.</p>
<p>Brinly Taylor aka UberLaggyDarwin/uld, is a contributor and device maintainer part of the maintainer &amp; bring-up team for the CyanogenMod community. He has been a core contributor to the project since 2012 with hundreds of contributions including being a big part of device bring ups. He’s currently a student in Adelaide, Australia, while spending some of his spare time reverse engineering low level firmware of Android devices.</p>
<p><strong>So how did you get started with programming and tinkering with devices?</strong></p>
<p>I started pretty young playing with Rockbox open source firmware for my Sandisk &#8211; got me into open source, plus then I got a Nintendo DS for homebrew projects.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s awesome, I remember when PS3 had Linux before Sony took the option away. I love hacking on consoles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You are one of the essential developers on HTC and Sony devices, how do you find time to work on personal projects (reverse engineering), be a student and maintain 6 devices?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t sleep much! :P.</p>
<p><strong>What device is your daily driver for a device?</strong><br />
Currently using a HTC Desire Eye (codename &#8216;eyeul&#8217;) but it swaps around a lot. I have like a fair few devices (15+) .</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for new programmers or aspiring programmers?</strong></p>
<p>Just keep going, don’t give up. Start on a project that is mostly supported already and have a look at bugs that exist but it’s always good to have programming experience before jumping in.</p>
<p><strong>What was the first big project you were involved in and how did it turn out?</strong></p>
<p>First big project relating to CM would have to be one of the device bring-ups as they are the core work to enable not just CM but many other CM based derivative works. This includes working with kernel source and reverse engineering certain hardware drivers to get certain features working in CM. A common one is of course the camera stack which is always a problem for CM developers due to it’s proprietary nature. We must build a device tree and kernel tree that is compatible with the HAL so that hardware features on the device will be functional on CyanogenMod. Working on feature enhancements on the framework is also quite fun and interesting!</p>
<p><strong>That seems like a ton of work, would you say the outcome is worth the input?</strong></p>
<p>Generally it is.</p>
<p><strong>So what do you do in your free time? Any pastimes you enjoy in the Outback?</strong><br />
I quite like cycling (I don’t modify bicycle’s though).. &amp; camping is quite nice in the outback in just a tent (no caravan) or swags is really nice, you can get away from the city lights.</p>
<p><strong>There is quite a few locations here in the Seattle area that you can escape the light pollution and enjoy the stars and horizon with mountains.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you participate in group cycling events?</strong></p>
<p>No. I’m not that confident . I do love my recently purchased road bike (1980’s style but refurbished) as well as my other bicycles.</p>
<p><strong>I have a carbon bike myself, in the city you get a completely different exercise with all of the elevation.</strong><br />
Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>You recently visited here in Seattle, do you feel you had enough time to meet everyone you wanted to and see what you expected?</strong></p>
<p>I really enjoyed my time in Seattle but it was too short, still getting to meet the guys that I work with on Gerrit was really nice and great to see what was happening with the Cyngn crew! Seattle is a really nice city with a great view of the ocean!.</p>
<p><strong>When it’s time to feed the beast, what’s the grub of choice?</strong><br />
I’d probably have to say fruit or olives but both don’t really count for a meal. I like pizza though (I’m a vegetarian).</p>
<p><strong>Pizza is an all time favorite, here in Seattle, you can find it everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I had pizza there. I don’t think it is as nice as home made pizza though!</p>
<p><strong>Who did you look up to when you started coding and hacking around with hardware?</strong></p>
<p>Jerpelea, Kali-, Cyanogen (Steve K) and some others but I don’t have all day to write up a huge list.</p>
<p><strong>After several discussions with Steve K. and Arcee, I have come to the conclusion they are neurotic when it comes to getting things working.</strong></p>
<p><b>Is there anything you would like to say to the community before we end our chat? I have had a great time chatting with you about all of the awesome things we see around the community.</b></p>
<p>Come hang out with us on IRC at #cyanogenmod-dev on freenode and say hello! (uld on freenode).</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/developer-spotlight-a-one-on-one-with-invisiblek">Developer Spotlight: A One On One With Invisiblek</a></h2>
			<time class="updated" datetime="2015-05-22T14:52:57+00:00" pubdate>May 22nd, 2015 &bull; Written by <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/author/bsxtn" rel="author" class="fn">bsxtn</a></time>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p dir="ltr">Welcome to our first Developer Spotlight, a short Q &amp; A with community staff. This is our way of taking a moment to recognize the many talented developers who contribute to one of the largest community driven open source projects around.</p>
<p>Dan Pasanen, also known as invisiblek, is a device maintainer inside of the CyanogenMod community. He has been a core contributor to the project since 2012 with nearly 1900 contributions. Dan is currently keeping himself busy maintaining multiple devices for CM, fixing device specific and CM-wide bugs. His current daily driver is a Verizon G3.</p>
<p><strong>You are well known for your work on a wide array of LG, HTC and Samsung devices and even did some work for the HP Touchpad. Out of every device you have worked on, which device would you say was the most fun and the absolute worst to work on? </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m not sure I can pick one device that I love or hate more than any other. They’re all a bit of a challenge; every OEM does some weird things. I’d say the HTC Incredible was probably the most enjoyable though, that’s when I started out with Android and just general hacking around in open source.</p>
<p><strong>Development on some of these devices can be extremely difficult, especially if there is a lack of documentation. What would you be the most difficult part of development on today’s devices?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know that there’s ever really much for documentation on any device. Most of the time looking at a similar device is about as much documentation as you can get. I’d say the most difficult part of working on devices today is dealing with all the little quirks that OEMs tend to do. LG G3’s camera was a good example of this. That one took a while to get sorted out.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What exactly made the G3 camera different from other devices?</strong></p>
<p> They messed with a header that is shared between the camera HAL (which is a proprietary lib we use from LG’s ROM in CM) and the framework’s camera client/server which we build from source in CM. They had added a new member to the camera_device_ops struct. Normally this wouldn’t cause an issue if they had added it to the end of the struct, but adding it to the beginning threw off the alignment between our source-build libraries and the proprietary HAL from LG. Even reverse-engineering the libraries didn’t make it apparent what the problem was. We were lucky enough to have some logging that showed a few numbers that didn’t line up between CM and the stock LG ROM and a little trial and error got us a preview image.</p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_lge_g3-common/blob/cm-12.1/include/hardware/camera.h#L97">https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_lge_g3-common/blob/cm-12.1/include/hardware/camera.h#L97</a></p>
<p>That line is some unknown LG stuff that just needs to be shoved in there to make things align.</p>
<p><strong>There are a lot of aspiring developers out there looking to get into this line of work or maybe just as a hobby, what advice or tips would you give them today? Is there a language you would recommend learning before another?</strong></p>
<p>Java and C++ are good languages if you’re just starting off learning to code. If you’re starting out with hacking around on a device, I recommend building a custom kernel and hacking around on that for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes working with nasty bugs you can start to feel metronomic and repetitive during development. What would you say helps you stay motivated during times like this?</strong></p>
<p>Tough question, I suppose I’m motivated by the addiction to tweaking out any piece of hardware I can get my hands on. Stock is never good enough. =)</p>
<p><strong>Coffee or Beer?</strong></p>
<p>Both are equally important. Coffee to cure the head cramps from the beer the night before. Beer to unwind after a morning of drinking coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Now that&#8217;s synergy.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you have any upcoming projects that you are excited about?</strong></p>
<p>Not especially.</p>
<p><strong>Fill in the blank. Bacon and _______.</strong></p>
<p>Moar bacon.</p>
<p><strong>Enough about the technical stuff, from Android’s inception to today’s date, which device is your most and which one would you say is your least favorite?</strong></p>
<p>The HTC Droid DNA is probably my favorite device. Insanely underrated and quite powerful for its age. I wouldn’t say I have a least favorite device, I hate love them all the same.</p>
<p><strong>Between work and life in general, what do you do with your free time? I noticed you recently purchased an 80’s Trac Moped, are you as diversified with a wrench as you are a keyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Most of my free time, when I’m not working on anything Android-related, is spent outdoors hunting, fishing, and snowmobiling. I wouldn’t say I’m all that great working in the garage, but I know enough to get by.</p>
<p><strong>Who was your role model you looked up to when you started coding?</strong></p>
<p>Another tough one, there were many. Koush, cyanogen and toastcfh seem to stick out.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything you would like to say to the community before we end our chat?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t feel overwhelmed and if you want to start out building and hacking, pick a device that’s at least relatively supported and learn from it.</p>
