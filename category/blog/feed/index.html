				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DEF CON 24 is officially in the books, so what better time to release a new CM snapshot, full of new features and security updates? These releases were branched on August 1st, 2016 (branch stable/cm-13.0-ZNH5Y) and bring our snapshot releases up from Android 6.0.1 r17 to Android 6.0.1 r61.</p>
<p>The first thing you should notice is our new custom boot &amp; dexopt screen, getting rid of that bright white for something a bit prettier and informative to look at while your phone upgrades; AMOLED users rejoice! Shoutout to Asher, Joey and Alexander M. for the awesome work!</p>
<p>On the features front, the full change log is linked off below, but we&#8217;ll call out some of the big ticket items:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Wi-Fi Tethering &#8211; automatically turn off hotspot after X minutes of inactivity</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Profiles &#8211; add notification light controls</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Do Not Disturb/Priority Mode &#8211; add notification light controls</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Privacy Guard/App data usage &#8211; Restrict apps to Wi-Fi or Cellular data only or block all internet access, per app</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Bluetooth Devices battery support &#8211; For compatible devices, a new battery icon will appear in the status bar to show the paired devices&#8217; battery level</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Lockscreen Wallpaper picker makes its return</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Lockscreen Weather and new Weather plug in support &#8211; see weather blog post</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Lockscreen Blur support (on a per device basis) and the ability to disable the effect</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Live Lockscreen support</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">New LiveDisplay hardware enhancements and API</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Snap Camera (per device basis)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Gello Browser (per device basis)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Lots of translations &#8211; shout out to the CM translations team on CrowdIn</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Cyanogen Apps support (<a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/capps-package-for-marshmallow">see blog post</a>, x86 is not supported yet)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Additional CM SDK APIs</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Security fixes galore</li>
</ul>
<p>Full change log: http://pastebin.com/ptatg6kh</p>
<p>Speaking of security, let&#8217;s touch on a few items. First, this release incoporates every Android security bulletin this year to-date, with a reported security patch level of August 5th, see https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2016-08-01.html and prior bulletins on what this entails.</p>
<p>Second, many users have likely read about the Quadrooter vulnerability coming out of DEF CON. Here, we have a bit of bad news. Of the four reported CVEs, we&#8217;ve been able to plug the ones that affected OSS code (ie the kernel), specifically CVE-2016-2059 and CVE-2016-5340. However, some of the reported vulnerabilities lie within OEM binary blobs, meaning we don&#8217;t have source access to resolve them.</p>
<p>So what does this mean? Unfortunately, for many devices we may never be able to completely resolve the outstanding issues, as OEMs are unlikely to release updated blobs across the generations of devices CM 13.0 supports, many of which were end of lifed on Lollipop or even earlier. We&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to remind you to be smart about where you source your applications, whether the Play Store, a FOSS equivelent or elsewhere on the internet &#8211; we&#8217;ve done our part to ensure the security of your device, but this and other parts are entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Builds will be rolling out as they complete from the build bots, with today&#8217;s roster below. As a reminder, you can flash this safely on top of the previous CM 13.0 ZNH0E releases without wiping. For further flashing instructions, see the wiki and the <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/cm-13-0-release-1">previous release post&#8217;s information</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to quickly address the circus of misinformation which has sprung up recently, particularly for everyone who uses CM or has been involved with the project.</p>
<p>tl;dr: CyanogenMod isn’t going anywhere, nor has Cyanogen Inc. discontinued it’s efforts towards the goal of bringing it to a larger audience. </p>
<p>It’s been seven years since I released the first version of CM, and so much has happened. The speed of the mobile space is only accelerating.  I co-founded the company three years ago, knowing fully the kind of response it might invoke- an epic mix of love and hate. We had a few successes at the Inc, but also our share of stuff which just didn’t work at all.  Anyone insane enough to do a startup will tell you that it will probably go wrong before it goes right, no matter how good your intentions are. All you can do is fix it, or it’s the end. You find out what works and what doesn’t work, and go towards the things which work.</p>
<p>CyanogenMod is something that works. Perhaps it doesn’t need to “go big” to work. I’m still wildly inspired by the idea of a platform which forces participation. Whether it’s the choice to hack your phone to bits and figure out how to install the damn thing to begin with, learning what’s possible afterwards, or just having the confidence of being in control, it still serves an important role which hasn’t been filled outside of the custom ROM community.  Cyanogen Inc (including myself) will still be sponsoring the project and will continue to have an active role in it’s development. Contrary to popular belief, we are not “pivoting to apps” nor are we shelving CM <img src="https://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  We’ll have additional information on the Inc site soon.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking with us and for all the awesomeness and support over the years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our last Developer Spotlight with Roman Birg. This time around we are moving the spotlight over to Christopher N. Hesse. He is responsible for several devices including the controversial Exynos devices like the Galaxy Note 4 and the Galaxy Tab S2. Developer Spotlights are a public nudge of appreciation to the developers that tirelessly work and contribute to a greater cause for a better OS.</span></p>
<p><b>Hi Chris, how is your day today? Welcome to your first Developer Spotlight! Can you give us an introduction to yourself? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>Hi Steve, my day has been great so far, thanks! My name is Christopher Noel Hesse, I’m 20 years old and live in Germany, where I’m studying at University at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m working in the automotive industry on my non-University days and enjoy working on the Android platform there as well.</span></p>
<p><b>It does not surprise me one bit that you tinker with cars as well as smartphones. What are you currently studying in college?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>I have been studying business informatics for two years now and hope to acquire my first degree by 2017.</span></p>
<p><b>By the time you graduate you will have quite a bit of experience under your belt. What got you into tinkering with Android and open source?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>I think it was the desire to actually be able to do what I want with a device I paid for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad situation with (major) Android version updates was another factor. I consider it quite funny seeing how the situation is still about as bad today, whereas Apple is supporting their devices at least twice as long and well on average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why I am an avid advocate of open source software. We need to be able to keep their devices alive when the OEM decides to drop it or our planet will drown in garbage soon.</span></p>
<p><b>Well, for the same price you get similar ‘premium hardware’. Apple has tried to set a precedent of expectation for software updates and support. It’s an awesome and sad thing at the same time. We have the community to continue support while the company getting paid for the hardware sets a short update path.</b></p>
<p><b>What was your first device and how long was it supported by the manufacturer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>My first (Android) device was the Samsung Galaxy 3 (GT-I5800, not the S3), which came with Android Eclair (2.1) and was supported for about a year if I remember correctly &#8211; at least it got the update to Froyo (2.2) which was a big deal at that time because it brought important improvements such as the Dalvik Just In Time (JIT) compiler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The community achieved an almost usable Gingerbread AOSP build and someone even continued to work on Ice Cream Sandwich (by the time I had moved on to a Sony Xperia S).</span></p>
<p><b>So you received an additional (nearly) two years of support for this device from the community? That is awesome. </b><b>I started with the Motorola Droid on Verizon, which developers supported up to Ice Cream Sandwich. What devices are you currently maintaining and do you think current hardware limitations will allow for longer community support?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>It really is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sadly never owned a Motorola device and apparently I’m late to the party, with Lenovo now owning their mobile division. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am currently responsible for the Exynos5 and Exynos7 platforms and I maintain the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Exynos family, the Galaxy Note 5 family as well as the Galaxy Tab S2 family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the funny thing is that all our current Exynos5/7 board support code is based off an Android Kitkat BSP release from the hardkernel guys, with tons of our own fixes and updates to it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means I am right now supporting devices running the latest Android Marshmallow (cm-13) using drivers that were designed for an iteration that was released several years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m quite confident I can support the Exynos 5430 and upwards for quite a while still.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You are a bigger key figure in the upbringing of a difficult platform than most people understand. Thanks for the hard work and dedication.</b></p>
<p><b>How is it working with the other components like camera and touchscreen on the Samsung devices? Is it just as difficult as the board?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>The difference in working with the two subsystems you pointed out is actually night and day on the devices I worked on so far. As for touchscreen, the kernel driver (which they are obliged to release as part of the GPL) is usually all you need and in most cases, it is just a simple Inter-Integrated-Circuit (i2c) bus that needs to be looked at for bug fixing and improvements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The camera however, is a different cup of tea. We are still struggling with the Exynos7 camera hardware to this day, because the user space drivers play a big role here as well. Samsung’s kernel space components, namely the Multi Format Codec (MFC) and others, provide well documented interfaces we can work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Android platform drivers build on top of the Video4Linux (V4L2) architecture and are utterly complex with specific Exynos graphics format mappings and whatnot. All in all, working with Exynos specific subsystems can be a pain &#8211; but an unparalleled learning experience at the same time.</span></p>
<p><b>I figured as much when it comes to the intricacies of Samsung’s policies and hardware. Enough of the technicalities though. What do you find yourself doing on the other side of the phones? You said you work in the automotive realm, any hobbies of choice?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>My hobbies these days basically denote to spending as much time with my friends as I can, including going to the local beach, playing paintball or just roaming the German cities at night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I played football for about eight years, but never really got into it again after that. I do enjoy watching the European Championship and other sport events though. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, I also grew to like skiing and I definitely wish I could do it more often.</span></p>
<p><b>I have never had the opportunity to ski. It looks painful to wipe out with a bit less control than on a skateboard. </b></p>
<p><b>I find it amazing that you find time to also spend countless hours contributing to CM. Where did you pick this skill up and when did you start?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>I can only recommend trying it out, it’s awesome! <img src="https://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a good question and a hard one to answer actually. I guess it was by the time I went to school for the last two years when I got bored more and more each day, so I started hacking on the Lego Mindstorms NXT set I got a while back (not using the click-to-code interface) and soon after that wanting to modify my Android smartphone to run the latest and greatest iteration everyone was talking about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started by learning Java but soon came to the conclusion I’d need to dive into C and C++ as well to be able to be successful with Android development. In the last two years, I started picking up extended Java and C++ courses at the University but at the very beginning, my programming knowledge was self taught I guess.</span></p>
<p><b>I went as far as to learn some Java and Python, I ended up focusing on design and web work. Do you have anybody you looked up to in the Android community?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH: </strong>I envy you web designers for I still think designing HTML pages using CSS is a mess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes I wish I could get into that topic as much as low level platform development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I looked up to Ethan Chen (Intervigil) for the most time, not necessarily because of the things he did for the community, but also the way how he did it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see him constantly pushing new patches to CyanogenMod (and Inc. probably), yet he still finds time to check in on the IRC channels and he’s always up for discussing all things Android and CM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, I always perceived him as an accessible, helpful and friendly source of knowledge, something that isn’t exactly prevalent in the Android open source community to this grade.</span></p>
<p><b>Ha, I wasn’t much of a designer, more of an organizer and apprentice, I always ask for input or another perspective.</b></p>
<p><b>Anything you want to say before we end this chat?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CNH:</strong> I’d like to take the opportunity to encourage more developers and enthusiasts to contribute to a large project like CyanogenMod to provide aftermarket support for awesome hardware, often left to be forgotten because of sub-par software. I know at least two really talented developers, working full time jobs at industry leaders such as Red Hat, who were trying to get more into Android development but were discouraged by the attitude of the community towards them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Words such as ‘kanging’ or others aren’t used nearly as often in other Linux communities as they are used in the Android one for example. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my opinion, fragmentation is a problem for Linux distributions as well, the more eyes you can get to look on a patchset, the better your code and overall software quality will be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel happy knowing the CyanogenMod community is steadily growing and new talents are joining constantly. It’s a great thing seeing all these people push code to the project daily and CM providing the infrastructure for a flawless experience (build servers, download servers, gerrit nodes, etc.).</span></p>
<p>It’s been a great experience for me so far and a steep learning curve, I can only hope to continue this awesome hobby for as long as possible. Cheers, and see you on the forum, or in the IRC chan!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a couple weeks since our last Developer Spotlight with Mike Bestas two weeks ago. This time around we are moving the spotlight over to Roman Birg. He is responsible for several repositories today at Cyanogen Inc., but is ultimately known for his work on AOKP (Android Open Kang Project). Developer Spotlights are a public nudge of appreciation to the developers that tirelessly work and contribute to a greater cause for a better OS.</span></p>
<p><b>Roman, nice to have you on here. How is life and the dream?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: Life is great! I’ve been living in Seattle with my girlfriend Dani for over two years now, and it has been amazing. We even got a chocolate lab who’s growing into a quite a fine doge (he had a lot of teenager energy). I can’t see myself leaving the PNW (Pacific North West), I love this place.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell us a bit about yourself, where do you come from and how did you start tinkering with code?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: Born in Russia &#8211; moved to Memphis, Tennessee when I was 7, where I stayed until I graduated college. Although I didn’t start programming until high school, I kind of always knew that’s what I wanted to do… there was just no easy way to get into it when I was younger (and on dial up at the time). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess I started with some small time website hacking. I remember in 6th grade, I downloaded the phpBB forum zip, and opening the zip and trying to make sense of the PHP files on the school Windows 2000 PC’s. I also had no idea how to “run” them, I definitely tried though. I stuck with it for a while and eventually I was at the point where I had to learn Flash to continue down the web development path. I did not continue down that path.</span></p>
<p><b>What was the first language you started with? And what was the first project you completed?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: My high school programming class started us out with Java, so I ran with that. Turned out it was the right call more or less &#8211; most of college courses stuck with Java as well. And then came Android (well, bytecode[smali] first for me). Since then I’ve been exploring other languages as many chances as I get, Java just doesn’t cut it alone anymore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What have you incorporated from working on AOKP while working at Cyanogen Inc.?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: A few features here and there (nav bar arrow keys I still use daily), and maybe my experience messing with quick settings? Mostly unicorn jokes though.</span></p>
<p><b>Not surprising, I am sure you rode in on one today.</b></p>
<p><b>What are you currently working on today?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: I’m working on a nasty NFC + Bluetooth beaming bug where an unsuccessful transfer could put the other device in a bad state and not able to receive future file/photo beams until a reboot… so much stuff going on the device at that time too, it’s pretty gnarly.</span></p>
<p><b>Bug hunts can lead to or help create other bugs. Also, messing with Bluetooth can be a nightmare.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>:  Are you suggesting I’ve introduced bugs before? Never!</span></p>
<p><b>You have been around for a while in the Android scene, what do you think big manufacturers need to improve or focus on to be a better device manufacturer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: Everyone is so focused on making the next huge product that will sell millions of phones. But no one is putting in the time or love to make a device that doesn’t feel rushed. Everyone always has to have the newest hottest hardware (I do too sometimes). It’s really hard to find a balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like if there was a _stellar_ phone out right now, that released with an MSM8974 (like the original OnePlus device), but it had the best camera on market, a fingerprint sensor, useful UI enhancement (CM anyone?), and proper LTE band support, I’d be all over it. You usually get two, maybe three out of four of those things, but never all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nexus devices are the closest thing to this for me, but as always, those are severely lacking in the camera department.</span></p>
<p><b>So do you think that is why everything feels ‘outsourced’ and ‘stamped/rehashed’?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: I think that’s a byproduct of OEMs iterating on designs they already have (or have seen working elsewhere). It’s expensive to make these things, and even more expensive to make them right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to see manufacturers not release a new flagship _every_ year. I’ll pick on Samsung here since they’re the easiest target. I think this is what makes them feel not brand-spankin’ new anymore. They’ll change out a tiny feature here and there every year, so it’s never a HUGE surprise what they announce next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I didn’t see Samsung for a year with a new flagship, and they came back the next year with a quality product, I would definitely think twice. I haven’t thought about buying a Samsung since the S3, which was just a stellar device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand there the business side of things to think of. If I was in Samsung’s position, I’d probably be doing something very similar. It’s generating them users and profit. The question is always about sustainability.</span></p>
<p><b>What device are you currently using as your daily driver?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: I’ve been using the Nexus 6P as my daily since it was released. It’s camera is decent for a Nexus device, but I’ve found that it really sucks at close up shots. I realize it’s a phone, but I’ve seen better.</span></p>
<p><b>I think that the camera is basically the most popular deciding factor for buyers today. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: It wasn’t for me. Definitely a big part though. I knew this thing wasn’t going to have the best camera (although it was advertised to have a better one, and that did factor into my decision). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the fingerprint unlock did it for me. It was between a 6P and a new Moto X. The fingerprint sensor was the biggest difference between the two (that I cared about) and I don’t regret the decision. I use it heavily throughout the day &#8211; when I know I need to use my phone, it’s ready to go by the time I’m looking at it.</span></p>
<p><b>I would have to concur. Security is at an all time paramount these days.</b></p>
<p><b>You have a ton of experience with the amount of devices you have been able to test. With the Android platform being pretty dominant in today&#8217;s industry, what advice would you give to upcoming developers?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: Write code. Don&#8217;t be scared of breaking stuff and dig in. I feel like that&#8217;s pretty standard advice, but if works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also it&#8217;s not always about *just* writing code &#8211; make sure your that code is actually solving a problem. It might be as small as a bug. The problem could even be learning to program! But it&#8217;s never about just sitting down at a computer for the sake of writing code.</span></p>
<p><b>Breaking starts way before fixing! I love that line!</b></p>
<p><b>Is there any developers you looked up to or reached out to while learning Android?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: I want to give a huge shout out to Faux123. It was the time of the LG G2, and he was doing his own kernels and AOSP builds, I took a stab and reached out to him for help because I was stuck… and to my surprise he replied back! He was very patient with me and I tried to extract as much knowledge from him as possible without being annoying. I don’t think I could have started AOKP without his prior help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coolest part was I got to meet him a few years later at the BBQ (and then again at the CM Dev summit last year). Cheers Paul!</span></p>
<p><b>Paul is a very skilled developer, I am pretty sure everyone who has flashed a Kernel has heard of him.</b></p>
<p><b>Anything else before we part ways and get back to work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>R. Birg</strong>: I just want to say thanks to all the other developers contributing to CM (and other ROMs!), you all have shown me the power of the open source community. It’s all about having fun and learning new things, and this is a great place to do both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for having me on here Steve!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since our <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/developer-spotlight-uberlaggydarwin">last Developer Spotlight</a> with Brinly Taylor (UberLaggy Darwin) in August 2015. This time around we are moving the spotlight over to Michael Bestas. Mike is responsible for several Oppo and Sony devices including the R7. Developer Spotlights are a public nudge of appreciation to the developers that tirelessly work and contribute to a greater cause for a better OS.</p>
<p><strong>Hey Mike, tell us a little bit about yourself. What can we expect from you in the average day?</strong></p>
<p><strong>M. Bestas:</strong> Since last year I work with my father as a smith (not sure this is the correct word, creating metal constructions) and in my free time I work on CM or tinker around with computers.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any shared interests that you have found working with metal and working with code?</strong></p>
<p><strong>M. Bestas:</strong> I always liked creating stuff. I&#8217;d say the common thing is that with the proper knowledge you can create anything you imagine, with metal or code.</p>
<p><strong>So taking a manifestation and creating a tangible/visible product right? That&#8217;s pretty awesome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Which devices are you currently maintaining and supporting?</strong></p>
<p><strong>M. Bestas:</strong> At the moment I officially maintain OPPO Find7 variants and helping in YU Yureka &amp; Yuphoria bringup. OPPO R7f is also close to official support, just got a couple bugs to squash first. I also maintain unofficial builds for 11 Sony Ericsson 2011 devices.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any devices you look forward to? Which of the new devices have caught your interest?</strong></p>
<p>To be honest most new flagships don&#8217;t surprise me anymore. If I had to choose one of the recent new devices, that would be Nextbit Robin. Its design is something new, not another dull device.</p>
<p><strong>We have a few floating around the office, what exactly attracts you to it?</strong></p>
<p>Mainly the colors and the fact that it&#8217;s not just another copy of some other manufacturer&#8217;s design. You can also put CM on it.</p>
<p><strong>I have to admit I like the modular look and feel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What do you think that today&#8217;s big manufacturers can do to be different in both hardware and software?</strong></p>
<p><strong>M. Bestas:</strong> I think device specs don&#8217;t matter a lot anymore, since we have powerful SoCs even on low end devices nowadays. The manufacturers should just figure out the right combination of hardware components and be a little bit more creative with design. The real problem is in software though, we need more bloatware-free devices with frequent OS updates. Google is doing great with their monthly security updates and developer previews, but I haven&#8217;t seen any other manufacturer come close to that. Security is important but sadly it&#8217;s ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Agreed. On another note, what does Mike Bestas do on his free time?</strong></p>
<p>Most of my time is spent fixing bugs or implementing features in CM. I also like experimenting with electronics and Internet of Things. Not very interesting, but that&#8217;s mainly caused by the poor economic situation in my country which doesn&#8217;t allow people try new things.</p>
<p><strong>Electronics are definitely entertaining to tear apart. I used to get into trouble for tearing my RC cars apart.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to start writing code and which language did you start on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>M. Bestas:</strong> My first programming experience was back in 2002 when I was about 11 years old, my uncle wrote some tutorials and installed Delphi on my PC. It was a nice experience but I didn&#8217;t take coding seriously until 2010 when I started looking into java/C and android stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Was there anyone in particular that inspired you to start programming?</strong></p>
<p>I think the biggest inspiration was from the FreeXperia team back in 2010 (defer, jerpelea, Kali-, nobodyAtall).</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any side projects you are currently working on you would like to share?</strong></p>
<p><strong>M. Bestas:</strong> Not at the moment, but I am planning something for the following months. Can&#8217;t reveal any details though. <img src="https://www.cyanogenmod.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any advice for those wanting to start programming?</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion if you really like coding and have determination towards it, you don&#8217;t need to wait for some advice. Start it now, the more you work on it the more you learn. There are many tutorials/books for any language you choose and you can solve 99% of your questions with a simple google search. If you&#8217;re willing to learn others will be also willing to help, so don&#8217;t expect to be spoon fed when asking for help.</p>
<p><strong>That sounds like some pretty solid advice. Are there any languages you recommend to start with or would you say languages are like an &#8216;acquired taste&#8217;?</strong></p>
<p><strong>M. Bestas:</strong> Well, language choice is mainly about personal taste but if I had to choose I&#8217;d recommend python or java for first-time learners, I had a lot of fun learning python (still a noob though)</p>
<p><strong>Python was the first language I attempted in college. Fun language and easy to pick up. Is there anything you would like to say before I end this interview?</strong></p>
<p><strong>M. Bestas:</strong> I&#8217;d like to see more frequent developer spotlight posts, keep &#8217;em coming!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a few weeks now, users of 13.0 nightlies have stumbled across a &#8216;Weather&#8217; category in their Settings dashboard, and rightfully wondered what it was (and why it&#8217;s empty). We&#8217;re now ready to provide some exposition on our newest feature to our mainline code.</p>
<p>Historically, we&#8217;ve used Yahoo! Weather and OpenWeatherMap to power the weather in the status bar or with our weather widget. Like most things these have had their pros and cons.</p>
<p>Yahoo! has been our default for some time, but they have made some recent changes to their API and policies, causing many bug reports of weather no longer working. Maintaining API compatibility is usually a trivial maintenence task, but Yahoo! Weather now requests every weather query go through an OAUTH implementation, and since these are traceable, counts against a quota limit 100k requests daily (which our millions of users quickly exceed even via previously anonymous requests) should we have just tried to use one static key. The quota and OAUTH changes make it so Yahoo! Weather no longer &#8216;just works&#8217; out of the box without user intervention.</p>
<p>Around the same 6 month timeframe that Yahoo! Weather made these changes, we were asked by OpenWeatherMap to start using tokenized calls for our requests &#8211; but without a limit at that time &#8211; and we obliged. In doing their research, it was no surprise that our userbase quickly exceeded what a normal &#8216;developer&#8217; account would reasonably use. Their pricing structure is not condusive of our use case, and as such we agreed to move away from our usage pattern of their platform.</p>
<p>This left an unfortuante gap, but also an opportunity. Our install base will exceed any weather provider&#8217;s caps for free, open-source or developer tiers if reported as all coming from one entity. However, each individual phone is usually making 12-24 requests a day (on average) and well below personal limits. With that in mind, we&#8217;ve built a pluggable model for our weather functionality, and through our platform SDK, one that can be repurposed by other apps or use cases beyond just our own.</p>
<p>As of nightlies April 17th and forward, you can download your own weather provider and have it seamlessly power the features mentioned above. This allows us to not have to worry about API limits and the like, as each user is reported independently. The first such weather provider is on the Play Store now (we are looking into FDroid and APK Mirror deployment for those that prefer that route) &#8211; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cyanogenmod.wundergroundcmweatherprovider">WeatherUnderground CM Weather Provider</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to emphasize this is the just first of many that will be compatible, and work for a sample OpenWeatherMap app under this new model is already under way. Likewise, developers worldwide have the capability to create and upload their own providers for regions and areas where our sample apps aren&#8217;t well suited.</p>
<p>Looking at our first sample, let&#8217;s answer a few questions preemptively.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) Do I have to pay for your apps?<br />
No &#8211; our samples are free (and the code is open sourced).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) WeatherUnderground is saying there is a fee for signup?<br />
The pricing structure of our samples all allow for a free ($0.00) developer account for personal usage. You do not have to pay to use this functionality with the providers we are starting with.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3) The UX (user flow) is clunky!<br />
Unfortunately, as the pain points in the post above describe, we can&#8217;t seed an API token into the OS, meaning there is some user setup involved. We&#8217;d love to avoid this, and provide one that &#8216;just works&#8217;, but the folks that power these things have a right to establish their own rules for usage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4) Will I have to pay in the future?<br />
For CyanogenMod uploaded samples, no. However, since this is now a public API for anyone to develop against, it&#8217;s up to individual publishers to set their pricing &#8211; just like any other app on the store.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5) Where is the source code for these samples?<br />
<a href="https://github.com/cyanogenmod?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Weather">On our Github of course</a>!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6) I don&#8217;t like/trust the information from your WeatherUnderground app, what about other samples?<br />
We&#8217;re working through other samples (eg OpenWeatherMap) and other developers can upload their own as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">7) Why not just bundle these into the OS?<br />
For starters, the UX leaves a lot to be desired, especially since there is no solid out of the box working state with zero user setup. Additionally, more apks equate to larger zip downloads, and since you would only need one provider setup &amp; selected, any others would be a waste of space and bandwidth. Finally, in the event of API breakage or compatibility needs, this gives us an opportunity to fix issues without requiring end users to update their OS version to a newer build.</p>
