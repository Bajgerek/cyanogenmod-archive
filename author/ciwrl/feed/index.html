				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a few weeks now, users of 13.0 nightlies have stumbled across a &#8216;Weather&#8217; category in their Settings dashboard, and rightfully wondered what it was (and why it&#8217;s empty). We&#8217;re now ready to provide some exposition on our newest feature to our mainline code.</p>
<p>Historically, we&#8217;ve used Yahoo! Weather and OpenWeatherMap to power the weather in the status bar or with our weather widget. Like most things these have had their pros and cons.</p>
<p>Yahoo! has been our default for some time, but they have made some recent changes to their API and policies, causing many bug reports of weather no longer working. Maintaining API compatibility is usually a trivial maintenence task, but Yahoo! Weather now requests every weather query go through an OAUTH implementation, and since these are traceable, counts against a quota limit 100k requests daily (which our millions of users quickly exceed even via previously anonymous requests) should we have just tried to use one static key. The quota and OAUTH changes make it so Yahoo! Weather no longer &#8216;just works&#8217; out of the box without user intervention.</p>
<p>Around the same 6 month timeframe that Yahoo! Weather made these changes, we were asked by OpenWeatherMap to start using tokenized calls for our requests &#8211; but without a limit at that time &#8211; and we obliged. In doing their research, it was no surprise that our userbase quickly exceeded what a normal &#8216;developer&#8217; account would reasonably use. Their pricing structure is not condusive of our use case, and as such we agreed to move away from our usage pattern of their platform.</p>
<p>This left an unfortuante gap, but also an opportunity. Our install base will exceed any weather provider&#8217;s caps for free, open-source or developer tiers if reported as all coming from one entity. However, each individual phone is usually making 12-24 requests a day (on average) and well below personal limits. With that in mind, we&#8217;ve built a pluggable model for our weather functionality, and through our platform SDK, one that can be repurposed by other apps or use cases beyond just our own.</p>
<p>As of nightlies April 17th and forward, you can download your own weather provider and have it seamlessly power the features mentioned above. This allows us to not have to worry about API limits and the like, as each user is reported independently. The first such weather provider is on the Play Store now (we are looking into FDroid and APK Mirror deployment for those that prefer that route) &#8211; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cyanogenmod.wundergroundcmweatherprovider">WeatherUnderground CM Weather Provider</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to emphasize this is the just first of many that will be compatible, and work for a sample OpenWeatherMap app under this new model is already under way. Likewise, developers worldwide have the capability to create and upload their own providers for regions and areas where our sample apps aren&#8217;t well suited.</p>
<p>Looking at our first sample, let&#8217;s answer a few questions preemptively.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) Do I have to pay for your apps?<br />
No &#8211; our samples are free (and the code is open sourced).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) WeatherUnderground is saying there is a fee for signup?<br />
The pricing structure of our samples all allow for a free ($0.00) developer account for personal usage. You do not have to pay to use this functionality with the providers we are starting with.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3) The UX (user flow) is clunky!<br />
Unfortunately, as the pain points in the post above describe, we can&#8217;t seed an API token into the OS, meaning there is some user setup involved. We&#8217;d love to avoid this, and provide one that &#8216;just works&#8217;, but the folks that power these things have a right to establish their own rules for usage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4) Will I have to pay in the future?<br />
For CyanogenMod uploaded samples, no. However, since this is now a public API for anyone to develop against, it&#8217;s up to individual publishers to set their pricing &#8211; just like any other app on the store.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5) Where is the source code for these samples?<br />
<a href="https://github.com/cyanogenmod?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Weather">On our Github of course</a>!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6) I don&#8217;t like/trust the information from your WeatherUnderground app, what about other samples?<br />
We&#8217;re working through other samples (eg OpenWeatherMap) and other developers can upload their own as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">7) Why not just bundle these into the OS?<br />
For starters, the UX leaves a lot to be desired, especially since there is no solid out of the box working state with zero user setup. Additionally, more apks equate to larger zip downloads, and since you would only need one provider setup &amp; selected, any others would be a waste of space and bandwidth. Finally, in the event of API breakage or compatibility needs, this gives us an opportunity to fix issues without requiring end users to update their OS version to a newer build.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We left the M release builds in the oven longer than we thought, but nothing a little graham cracker and chocolate can&#8217;t make that much better. CM13.0 brings Android 6.0.1 (r17) goodies such as the battery saving &#8216;doze&#8217; functionality and new permissions model, alongside the CM features you&#8217;d expect.</p>
<p>This is the first non-nightly release for CM13, which means this will the first step many of you take into the world of Marshmallow. M brings along a handful of items that will pose issues if you are caught unaware, so in the interest of saving you some potential heartburn, we&#8217;re going to highlight that there are a couple of different update scenarios applicable.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Update scenario 1</strong></span>: CM 12.1 release or nightly user + Googley bits</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Update steps: Update to the latest TWRP image available for your device. Download CM13.0 (if available for your device) and your Googley bits of choice for M. Reboot to recovery, and flash CM13.0 and the Googley bits one after another. If you reboot in between CM and the extra package, you will have a bad time due to how the permissions model works in M. Reboot out of recovery only after you have flashed both packages.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you trigger an assert violation (radio, bootloader, etc), fulfill the requirement it complains about. These asserts are in place to make sure your firmware matches what CM13/Android 6.0.1 needs and you can actually use your device/phone as a device/phone.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Update scenario 2</strong></span>: CM 12.1 release or nightly user + No Google apps</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Update steps: Update to the latest recovery available for your device (CM recovery or TWRP). Download CM13.0. Reboot to recovery and flash CM13.0. Done, easy as that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you trigger an assert violation (radio, bootloader, etc), fulfill the requirement it complains about. These asserts are in place to make sure your firmware matches what CM13/Android 6.0.1 needs and you can actually use your device/phone as a device/phone.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Update scenario 3</strong></span>: CM 13.0 nightly user</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Update steps: Stop. Step away from the phone. Do not flash these builds, you are already on a newer codebase (Android 6.0.1_r22). Attempting to flash these release builds will result in crashes due to attempted database downgrades. Don&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you want to swap off nightlies and stick to our release channel, you will have to wipe to take these builds.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Update scenario 4</strong></span>: Nexus 6P (angler), Nexus 5X (bullhead), Nexus 9 (flounder) users</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Update steps: Pick scenarios 1 or 2 (based on your usage) but with one added (and very important extra step). Nexus devices now ship with a large portion of their proprietary code in a vendor partition on the device itself. This is not something CM&#8217;s installation will update for you. If your vendor partition doesn&#8217;t match with the CM build, you will be met with an error on boot up that the system is potentially corrupted. To prevent this message (and ensure things like camera function), you should make sure you are on the latest available vendor image for your device. Vendor images can be found in the stock Nexus factory images provided by Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">here</a>. Extract the latest available zip and flash the vendor image through your bootloader with &#8216;fastboot flash vendor vendor.img&#8217;.</p>
<p><b>CM13 Changelog (the big stuff):</b></p>
<p>A delta between 12.1 and 13.0 will show thousands of changes (Google&#8217;s, Qualcomms&#8217;s, Linux Foundation, CM Community&#8217;s, etc), but let&#8217;s take a look at the ones that you are likely to notice:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many users have noticed that we haven&#8217;t enabled WhisperPush capabilities into CM13, though there are patches up that include that updated work and integration into the MMS apks for both 12.1 and CM13.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve ultimately made the decision that we will no longer be supporting WhisperPush functionality directly within CyanogenMod. Further, WhisperPush services will be end-of-lifed beginning Feb 1st 2016. As this is a server side implementation, all branches of CM from CM10.2 and forward will be affected.</p>
<p>We are still very big proponents of the secured messaging protocol, but maintenence of our own implementation saw some hiccups (longstanding registration issues &amp; issues with various countries) which ultimately led to our decision. Our recommendation to users who rely on this functionality is to hop onto the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&amp;hl=en">Signal application</a> (details at bottom on this post).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To recap:</span></strong></p>
<p>A little over <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/whisperpush-secure-messaging-integration">two years ago</a> we debuted our joint project to integrate WhisperPush into CyanogenMod.</p>
<p>Late in the 12.1 cycle, we began updating the protocol to reflect Open Whisper System&#8217;s <a href="http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/98015/">upstream changes</a>. These proved to be non-trivial with respect to the &#8216;headless&#8217; nature of the WhisperPush service.</p>
<p>We transitioned the work to CM13, instead opting to <a href="http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/123327/">implement directly within our Messaging application</a>. However, with the rapid adoption of the official Signal application, our implementation into Messaging would have been a seemingly unnecessary fork. Analyzing the costs of SMS verification (many thanks to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> for their support on this), usage traffic, server costs and registration numbers, forking would serve no larger long-term user benefit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">User Impact:</span></strong></p>
<p>If your current device &amp; number is registered with our WhisperPush, you can unregister via the Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; WhisperPush directly via the device (CM10.2 &#8211; CM12.1)</p>
<p>If you no longer have access to your registered device or number, or otherwise don&#8217;t unresgister on your own, we will unregister all numbers on February 1st, 2016. Unregistering numbers will ensure that your active clients don&#8217;t run into the &#8216;iMessage problem&#8217; and send messages into the void.</p>
<p>After February 1st 2016, messages will no longer go through our service, and will be sent as regular SMS messages instead.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signal:</span></strong></p>
<p>We strongly encourage those who used WhisperPush regularly to install the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&amp;hl=en">Signal application</a>. Combining TextSecure (encrypted text) and RedPhone (encrypted voice) capabilities, this open source application comes directly from Open Whisper Systems (who helped us create and implement WhisperPush) to make secure communication simple and easy. It&#8217;s also cross-platform, with a Desktop beta in flight and iOS support as well. See more information and sources via <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Open Whisper Systems&#8217; website</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank Moxie and his team for their support of CyanogenMod over the past two years, their continued maintenance of the secured protocol and their passion for making security simple for users.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re two months into the CM13 Marshmallow work and nearing our feature complete mark in anticipation of a release towards the end of January. As we work towards finishing and stabilizing the multitude of devices in our roster, we&#8217;ve now unblocked the other half of our contributor teams &#8211; our Translators. These 1600+ individuals are responsible for localizing the software for our features (which we&#8217;ll go through on another post) and new regions. This post is for all of you translators.</p>
<p><a href="http://translate.cyanogenmod.org/">CrowdIn</a> is now CM13 ready! Michael Bestas (translation lead) has done his due diligence and carried forward as many translations as possible from CM12.1 to reduce the workload for CM13. In total, we count roughly 380 new strings (not including plurals) as a delta from 12.1.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are now making use of CrowdIn&#8217;s <a href="https://support.crowdin.com/articles/versions-management/">new version management</a> functionality. The ultimate goal here is to reduce the amount of effort required on the part of our translators. One item of note here is that the new system is additive &#8211; to complete the translations for 13.0 you should translate both the 12.1 and 13.0 projects, as 13.0 only shows the new and untranslated strings.</p>
<p>Finally, the project for languages not originally in AOSP (project CM AOSP on CrowdIn) is not yet 100%. If you are the owner of one of these projects, please keep an eye out as we should be set for these by the end of the week.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, reach out to Michael through the tool, IRC or (if you have joined) the Translators G+ community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been pretty quiet publicly on the CM13 (Marshmallow) progress, but we&#8217;ve been busy bees behind the scenes. Today, we&#8217;ve enabled the first wave of devices to receive CM13 nightlies. Now, before you jump head first into flashing these, please take a moment to read the items below &#8211; as they will impact your experience.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are on CM 12.1 YOG4P or CM 12.1 YOG7D releases, we recommend you stay on course with the SNAPSHOT release channel and not jump to nightlies unless you are willing to accept a dip in quality. Our stable branches are vetted, CTS run and (in some cases) shipped on retail devices &#8211; which means the quality of those branches is far and above that of nightlies. We&#8217;d advise these folks to stay on the SNAPSHOT train, and we&#8217;ll have a quality approved SNAPSHOT for CM13 sometime Jan.</li>
<li>If you are on a 12.1 nightly, you can &#8216;dirty flash&#8217; CM13 (read update like any sane person) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as long as you also update your third party addons in the same pass</span>. This means, if you use Xposed, OpenGapps, etc. flash a Marshmallow compatible version of them immediately after your CM13 flash.</li>
<li>If you have taken any unofficial, XDA or self made builds of the CM13 source code, we&#8217;d advise you to wipe upon coming to our official nightlies as we cannot ensure upgrade compatibility with third party distributions. Of course, you are welcome to not heed our suggestion, but don&#8217;t blame us if something goes sideways.</li>
</ol>
<p>The device roster is starting small, and will grow over the next few weeks.</p>
<ol>
<li>OnePlus One (bacon)</li>
<li>Nexus 7 (deb &amp; flo)</li>
<li>LG G4 (h815)</li>
<li>Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 (mondrianwifi)</li>
<li>LG GPad 7.0 (v400 &amp; v410)</li>
<li>LG G3 Verizon (vs985)</li>
<li>Moto X 2014 (victara)</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s a decent spread of OEMs and a bit all over the place, but as stated, we&#8217;re working on our other 12.1 devices and this list will grow rapidly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few months, device maintainers new and old have been pushing hard to get support up to par for a wide range of devices. While some flagships (M9/S6/G4, etc) still need more time in the proverbial oven, we&#8217;ve seen a large increase in the medium range devices.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Huawei </span></p>
<p>Thanks in part to device contributions from Huawei&#8217;s team directly, we are now supporting the Honor 4 &amp; 4x (cherry), Ascend Mate 2 (mt2) and Snapto (g620_a2). These devices represent the first set of Huawei devices we&#8217;ve supported since CM 7(!) and it&#8217;s nice to see the company supporting the community ahead of the rumored Huawei Nexus. We&#8217;re expecting good things to come here.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motorola</span></p>
<p>Moto continues to make headway with their budget line &#8211; and we&#8217;ve now enabled support for both the Moto E (otus) and G (osprey) 2015 variants.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Xiaomi</span></p>
<p>This Chinese OEM has been making waves in Asia. That wave has reached CM with the support of the Mi3w and Mi4 (cancro).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Smartfren</span></p>
<p>The &#8216;Powered by Cyanogen&#8217; AndroMax Q (rendang) is an Indonesian device with the unique nature of being the only CDMA Cyanogen Inc device.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WileyFox</span></p>
<p>The newest OEMs on this list will be seeing their release in Europe soon &#8211; and as with all Cyanogen Inc devices &#8211; we&#8217;ll have sources and nightlies ready to go alongside their delivery.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oppo</span></p>
<p>Oppo has shown their strong community support for nearly two years now, and we are working on their latest R7, R7Plus, and R5 devices (with previous support for the Find 5, N1, Find 7, and N3), thanks in large part to their device donations. Look for the latest waves of Oppo devices to hit CM sources and downloads soon.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Samsung, HTC &amp; LG</span></p>
<p>These perennials have more device variants than we can count, but we can knock a couple off the list with support for the Korean G3 (f400), M8 Dual Sim (m8d),  Galaxy S5 variants of Japan/China (kltekdi/kltechn) and the S5 Duos (klteduos/klteduoschn).</p>
<p>With more to come and others in the wings (eg. Nvidia Shield tablet), we&#8217;re glad to welcome our newest team members and devices. If you are working on a port that you&#8217;d like to see join the official roster, checkout our <a href="https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Doc:_Submitting_A_Port">wiki page on submission guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>-The CyanogenMod Team</p>
<p>PS. Have you seen the new contributors screen in your &#8216;About Phone&#8217;? It takes an army to support the combined 200+ devices receiving CM 11, 12.0 and 12.1.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Tapping into my inner Balmer with the post title</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;re queuing up releases across three branches this evening, releasing into the wild CM 11.0-security, 12.0-security and our very first 12.1 release. As always, these releases are being marked as &#8216;known good&#8217; by their maintainer, and signed-off individually. This means that not every CM device will receive a release &#8211; only those marked as &#8216;Good to go&#8217; by the maintainer.</p>
<p>The 11.0 and 12.0 builds are security releases built on top of the last <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/releases-11-12-final">CM11/12.0 releases</a>, modified to include the recent security disclosures, including the vulnerabilities in Stagefright. Users of the previous 11/12.0 release builds are encouraged to update. Users of 11.0/12.0 weeklies (nightlies) will see no net change, and need not update.</p>
<p>The CM12.1 release marks our first Android 5.1.1 release which brings our IMAP idle support, SDK v1 release and the security fixes mentioned previously.</p>
<p>If you are updating to any of these builds, please pay close attention that the CM release version and the version of your third party installs (kernels, mods, gapps, etc) are compatible.</p>
<p>This is a substantial amount of releases, so bear with the build-bots as they go through the list. Should there be any hiccups in the process, we&#8217;ll resolve them tomorrow; for now, we&#8217;re going to go grab a beer or three.</p>

<p><em>A local application can reliably determine the foreground application, circumventing the getRecentTasks() restriction introduced in Android 5.0.</em><br />
<em>This is rated as a moderate severity vulnerability because it can allow a local app to access data normally protected by permissions with a &#8220;dangerous&#8221; protection level.</em></p>
<p>This particular patch was merged into CM sources on August 12th. As a result, apps that relied on attaining a list of running processes via the now plugged hole will fail to function properly. This includes (but is not limited to) apps like Greenify, FMR Memory cleaner, Zillow and System Panel [1]. Google&#8217;s AOSP r9 release also contains this fix, so most devices receiving a 5.0 or a 5.1 OTA update from manufacturers will also be impacted.</p>
<p>[1] System Panel&#8217;s author has put out an updated app that contains a workaround for the blockage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to know if you have an affected application</span></p>
<p>If you take a look at your logcat, apps that are blocked due to the vulnerability being addressed will show an error message with the contacts REAL_GET_TASKS. If you see this in your logs, you have an app that is affected by this protection mechanism.</p>
<p>Affected apps will need to implement workarounds as needed.</p>
